  Put Your Career in the Fast Lane with CAR
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>

 <p>
  I found out about computer assisted reporting (CAR) after being a reporter for half a decade. At the time, I thought I knew a lot about how to do my job, but that changed in 1993 when I learned there was an important reporting skill that I knew next to nothing about. I discovered this at the National Institute of Computer Assisted Reporting’s (NICAR) fust national computer conference in Raleigh, N.C. This may sound like a cliche, but that weekend changed my life.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I left the conference, I didn’t know exactly how to use a computer for research, but I got a taste of what CAR could add to my reporting. It felt like I had done all my reporting in a 10-by-10-foot room, and then someone walked to a window that I hadn’t noticed, opened it, and said, “You know, you can do stories out here also.” I looked out to find a world I had missed, a world full of stories CAR would help me find.
 </p>
 <p>
  What did I learn? Well, let’s start with what I already knew. Every government agency collects information all the time. That’s no big mystery, because every reporter uses information collected and stored by government agencies. We get the information one record at a time, as we need it for stories. With computer assisted reporting, you no longer ask for one record, you ask for every record. “Put it all on a disk,” you can tell an agency, “so I can look at it on my own computer at my own speed.” This gives the reporter the power to do his own research. No longer does he depend on the agency he’s investigating to do the work for him. How many times in your career have you discovered something and wondered, “Is this just a fluke or a widespread problem?” CAR helps you answer that question. It also helps you hold officials’ feet to the fire. When they dismiss your question by saying, “That one just fell through the cracks,” you can come back at them and say, “Actually, we looked at the records and found 46 more examples of the same thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  OK, I can hear some of you saying, “Cut the hyperbole. You’re sounding like one of those get-rich-quick guys on an infomercial.” I apologize if I sound that way, but the truth is that computer assisted reporting has been a boon to me. Since starting my computer training, I’ve accepted two full-time investigative reporting jobs, my salary has more than doubled, and most importantly, I’ve produced the best stories of my life.
 </p>
 <p>
  For me, deciding whether I should learn how to use computers to research stories was a no-brainer. I felt you had to do it. It seemed clear that developing even rudimentary skills would allow a reporter to begin to produce significant stories he couldn’t find in any other way. So, why on earth are there so few television journalists who effectively use computers in their reporting? Here are the reasons I hear all the time, and my response for those of you who may be struggling with these issues in your newsroom.

 <p>
  response: Don’t blame the computer for bad writing. If you focus on sterile aspects of a story, you’ll get a sterile story. Use the numbers generated by your analysis to build a foundation for your story, but don’t focus on the numbers exclusively.
 </p>
 <p>
  A lot of times I will boil a mountain of research down to a line or two in the script, but that one line forms the backbone of my story. Then, just like with any other story, I concentrate on storytelling, which means finding people. Since I have thousands of records at my fingertips, I find dramatic examples that I wouldn’t have found without the computer’s help. For instance, I once got pictures of an emergency medical technician with five drunken driving convictions on his record who was driving an ambulance. His employer didn’t know about the driving record that the computer allowed me to find. I found a principal and a teacher working in Ohio schools who had both been previously jailed for sexual assaults on students. I discovered them because the computer could quickly sort through half a million records. For another story, I found a man who got a $300,000 loan from the city even though he owed local government more than $40,000 in property taxes.

  Using a computer to research stories takes too long. I have to turn a story today. True, doing a computer assisted project can take a long time. But I urge news directors to realize investing time on the front end can mean many payoffs in the long run. I collect data for almost all of the time-consuming projects I work on, but then I keep the data and make it available to the newsroom as a reference tool for quick-turn stories. For example, I once obtained a database of crime reports from the Columbus police department to use on a project. For months after my story aired, we used the database to add context to daily crime stories that the station covered. When a murder happened, we could look at the data and say it happened in a very dangerous neighborhood, much worse than the typical Columbus neighborhood. That way we didn’t needlessly scare viewers with the idea that the whole city was crime infested.

  You have to purchase a lot of equipment to do a computer assisted story, and I can’t get my boss to buy me a new pack of pencils, much less a high-powered computer. With the price of computer equipment dropping, cost is not an excuse. You can get a computer for $2,000 today that CAR reporters could only dream about five years ago. So even if you have to buy your own equipment (and initially a lot of CAR reporters did just that), that’s not a good enough excuse to avoid learning these skills. However, any news director who doesn’t equip his
