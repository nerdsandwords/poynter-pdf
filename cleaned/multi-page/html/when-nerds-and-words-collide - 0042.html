  The Contraption
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   By Bob Port

 </p>
 <p>
  I will never forget Elliot Jaspin with his clickity-clack tape drive contraption.
 </p>
 <p>
  It sat on a folding table in front of the classroom, a room filled with librarians, who aren’t easily impressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tape machine, no bigger than a suitcase, reminded me of the commercial reel-to-reel tape decks I’d seen as a boy in my uncle’s radio station, except that these tapes were the big ones. Government tapes, the size of a Frisbee. They were the tapes I’d seen as a boy on TV in episodes of
  <em>
   Mystery Science Theater
  </em>
  during cutaway scenes of Cold War missile control centers. You know the picture: Dozens of closet-sized tape cabinets with tapes jerking back and forth. Rows of lights flashing. Air Force generals, bathed in fluorescent light, pouring over massive printouts. The sound of high-pitched Morse code in the background.
 </p>
 <p>
  The computer attached to Jaspin’s baby tape drive was a state-of-the-art portable in its day, which meant it cost a bundle. It had what seemed then to be a huge screen, but would only be a bit bigger than one of those personal information organizers you see young stock brokers sporting nowadays. It was a monochrome gas-plasma screen, an eerily glowing red affair that never did catch on because it practically needed a car battery to operate without a wall outlet. Its boxy size and shape reminded me of the Singer portable my mother had kept in her bedroom closet. The kind with a lid and leather handle on top - so heavy you’d never carry it farther than the kitchen table if you could avoid it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Click, click, click, click, click.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jaspin’s tape reels rotated slowly and as they did, a little relay clicked on and off inside. As inches of magnetic tape moved across the heads, lines of data appeared on the screen. You could imagine the words flowing through the cable into the computer. Jaspin pecked at the keyboard: G-E-O-R-G-E S-T-E-I-N-B-R-E-N-N-E-R. He poked the Enter key like a piano player would finish with a high note. Click, click, click, click, click. Seconds later, a couple of rows of names, dates, and dollar amounts blurted across the screen. Then data stopped appearing for a while. Then it quickly filled the screen, spewing out pages of listings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wow.
 </p>
 <p>
  There it was. Magic. The fantasy of an investigative reporter realized. Every federal campaign contribution made during the last decade by the owner of the New York Yankees, who was a shipbuilder and colorful local figure in Tampa Bay, where I lived then. All this was culled in less than a minute from more than a million records. On paper, I imagined, those records would fill a room. With Jaspin’s contraption, I could squirrel away those same records - or others - in a desk drawer. When I wanted, I could shuffle this stack of electronic index cards and uncover secrets that would make news.
 </p>
 <p>
  This, I thought, was powerful stuff and I had to have it. I was in love at first sight - in love with a damned computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was in 1988.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jaspin, a gray-haired Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter from the
  <em>
   Providence Journal-Bulletin,
  </em>
  was showing off
 </p>
 <p>
  for a Poynter Institute seminar. I was a 30-something reporter at the
  <em>
   St. Petersburg Times,
  </em>
  looking for a new idea. This eureka moment changed the way I think about journalism forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  For years I had been proudly doing things, as most investigative reporters had, the old-fashioned way. I’d pour over court dockets and real estate records at dusty hallway tables, making lists on yellow legal pads. I’d built filing cabinets filled with obscure documents retrieved from microfilm in government offices. I’d compared little bits of information in one place with little bits in another - by eye and by hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was a scientist, of sorts, I told myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  What Jaspin (and a colleague, Dan Woods) had worked out wasn’t easy. However, in an age of computer automation, it was so, so overdue. Why shouldn’t reporters use computers to process records? It’s faster and better. Jaspin and Woods overcame the big obstacles: First, most government records were stored on tapes. Second, most computers that could read these tapes cost too much for journalists to acquire. They simply adapted the inexpensive personal computer, then a new invention, to read big old data tapes. It was a natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the impractical became possible. With it, new orders of magnitude in reporting became possible, too. Why bother looking at a few records or even a hundred records of something? Let’s just look at
  <em>
   every
  </em>
  record of something. Why not start a fishing expedition? The fishing is so easy. Armed with a computer, the journalist became David. The computer became a slingshot. Any subject was Goliath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Computer assisted reporting, Jaspin’s name for his new system, became a craze for journalists. Many adopted it with a kind of religious zeal. Standard procedure was to locate a nerd hiding within the newsroom, usually someone who had used pocket protectors and slide rules in high school. He would be confined to an untrammeled comer of the newsroom where the electromagnetic radiation could be contained and,
  <em>
   voila,
  </em>
  impressive findings would emanate. If someone needed computer assisted reporting, he or she had only to seek out the CAR guru and obtain a blessing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its mystery, there was no mistaking that stories built on computer assisted reporting had impact. CAR was answering big questions. It began to win many Pulitzer Prizes. Supported by an editor with a passion for investigative projects, I embraced this culture wholeheartedly:

   Bob Port is special assignment editor for The Associated Press in New York. He heads a team of AP national writers who do investigative reporting, often using computer assisted reporting techniques. Before joining the AP in 1995, Port worked 12 years at the
   <em>
    St. Petersburg Times,
   </em>
   where he worked on special projects and introduced the newspaper to computer assisted reporting.
