  Journalists: Turn Around
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>

 <p>
  I started doing computer assisted reporting by accident. I didn’t even know that I was doing a form of CAR until I went to the first NICAR conference in Raleigh, N.C. Of course, I had to twist the definition of CAR to fit what I was doing and not what, at that time, everyone else was still calling “Database Journalism.” I took the words literally: that CAR meant using a computer to assist in reporting. I hadn’t done a big database project or spent weeks crunching numbers to make connections that were not possible before computerization. In fact, when I started doing CAR in 1982,1 was just trying to make enough money as a free-lancer to support my family.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only way I found to do that was to crank out multiple versions of the same story for different magazines, and the only way to do that was to use a personal computer and CAR techniques. Of course, I was a sort of idiot savant of CAR because I didn’t even know that was what I was doing. I was just making it up as I went along because I had to. And what I was making up was using CAR for daily journalism, not projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  I started using my PC to short circuit some time-consuming processes that kept me from writing. I stopped going to the library when I discovered that I could get a cheap version of Dialog through CompuServe. I didn’t know that I was querying a database, I just knew that I could get background information without wasting a couple of hours traveling to the library.
 </p>
 <p>
  I learned to use a spreadsheet, not because I saw the journalistic possibilities, but because I was doing a story about this upstart company called Lotus Development and some computer program called 1-2-3 that was exciting to all the accountants.
 </p>
 <p>
  I used the spreadsheet for the first time to analyze data because I was online to the Department of Education’s bulletin board service, and they had all these statistics in files that could only be read with a spreadsheet. And once I opened the files, all that stuff I had learned about Lotus 1-2-3 suddenly made sense. When I started looking at the numbers in different ways, I saw that I could sell three more pieces based on just sorting the data. I even figured out that the graphing capabilities of Lotus could help me sell pieces to all those math-phobic editors. They were impressed that I could visualize the data for them and not hit them with a lot of mind-numbing numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was stunned when I found out that other people were not only using some of the techniques that I had fumbled through, but were using it in a clear, systematic way to do “real” reporting and not the quick knockoffs for a 800-word magazine piece.
 </p>
 <p>
  After attending a few conferences, it hit me that there had been a fundamental change in how news was gathered and processed, and it happened while most of us were too busy reacting to breaking news to notice. And, for the first time, the changes were not driven by management’s desire to cut costs with automation. Computers were first put in newsroom not to do better journalism, but to save money by getting rid of the typographers’ union.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, how journalism was altered had nothing at all to do with the news business. It had to do with the development of the personal computer and the sophisticated business programs that run on it such as word processors, spreadsheets, and databases. It also grew from advances in telecommunications - the ability to quickly transmit information over standard phone lines and to be able to interact with millions of computers around the world. And it grew out of some weird, spontaneous desire to put online every scrap of information known to man.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today’s journalist is likely to carry a laptop loaded with a word processor, a communications program, a spreadsheet, a database, and a contact manager. The story will be transmitted from the scene over a cellular telephone or even a portable satellite dish.
 </p>
 <p>
  While hardware and software play a big part in altering journalism, the major change is where information resides and how journalists get to it. Online databases and the Internet are vast storehouses of information that reporters and editors can tap into in an instant to add greater depth to stories. Even the nature of interviewing has been altered with the use of electronic mail. I’ve just about eliminated telephone tag by doing most of my interviews via e-mail.
 </p>
 <p>
  But most reporters and editors are behind the curve in utilizing all the technology to commit better journalism. One of the reasons is lack of knowledge and training. Training is not a priority in most newsrooms. “Here’s your workstation; press that key to start a new story and, when you’re finished, press that key and it’ll go to your editor.” Young reporters are tossed into the deep end of the pool and are expected to learn the tricks of the trade by osmosis. Even seasoned reporters get stuck in ruts because there is usually no continuing training at their organizations. And of course, there’s denial: “Look, I get a piece in the paper every day. What do I need to learn all this new stuff for?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Another reason for not using the technology is computer phobia. Even in the middle of the “information age” there are still lots of people, in and out of the news business, who are intimidated and frightened by computers. Geekspeak, compu-babble, and TLAs have done nothing to ease anyone’s fear of computers.
