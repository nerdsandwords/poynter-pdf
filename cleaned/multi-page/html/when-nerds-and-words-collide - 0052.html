  My place in the CAR world would be that of an advocate for using online research in news reporting and for incorporating the whole gamut of CAR within the curriculum of college journalism education. I’ve written books and articles on the subjects and participated in numerous panels and workshops in the last decade. I came into this position through a slow, groping, tortuous path that developed into a major highway by 1993.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s how.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had double-majored in chemistry and biology. By the time hand-held calculators became common household implements, I was a general assignment reporter for a small daily newspaper in central California.
 </p>
 <p>
  That newspaper converted to offset printing and cold type in 1968.1 got involved in maintaining those machines and a new composing room tool - a dedicated word processor. By 1980, we had several of these word processors, a number of phototypesetters, and a Compugraphic OCR device that was really hot
 </p>
 <p>
  -    when it worked. As managing editor of
  <em>
   The Daily Press
  </em>
  in Paso Robles, Calif., and company vice president, I had responsibility for computerizing our newsroom and classified operations. The following year I computerized the circulation and display advertising operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mainframe computer that drove both our news front end and classified advertising sat in a small room with its own air conditioning and power. In the course of daily data file maintenance, we “talked” to the computer through a Texas Instruments KSR (Keyboard-Send and Receive) 820. One day in 1984, the KSR quit working. The people at Texas Instruments said it would cost $720 for their technicians to set foot on our property
 </p>
 <p>
  -    sometime in the next 72 hours. When I argued that we were a daily newspaper and could not afford 72 hours of down time, TI invited me to purchase a “preferred maintenance” contract for only $15,000 per year.
 </p>
 <p>
  I left the service call open, but I was determined to do what I could to solve the problem myself. It took me about four hours. In the process, I had to download a shareware communications program (ProComm) from a bulletin board in San Jose. I was wide-eyed with my first views of FIDO Net and the wealth of information to which it could connect me. I had become “connected.” Through FIDO Net I found EPA reports and data sets, some FDA information, and even material from the National Institutes of Health. I learned that the Internet was some mysterious system that allowed different networks, such as FIDO Net and CompuServe, to exchange information.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1985,1 set up a newsroom bulletin board. Our county-seat correspondent began filing stories directly with us so that we were no longer at the mercy of a pony wire. Soon a political columnist working out of Colorado began using our BBS, and then we began helping a news service based in the state capital get ready for the online age.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 75th anniversary of Boy Scouts of America in 1985 presented a unique opportunity for me to put this new technology to
 </p>
 <p>
  work. I carried a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100 computer with me as I accompanied a group of Scouts on a two-week tour that culminated at the National Jamboree in Fort A.P. Hill, Va. I filed daily reports directly into the computers of AP’s Los Angeles bureau.
 </p>
 <p>
  During this same time (1984-85), I also got involved with spreadsheet and database software. Intuitively, I began to put some of this to work in the newsroom. I set up some automatic team and league statistics calculators for our sports desk. I poured key city and county budget numbers into spreadsheets. And I assumed that “all reporters” at larger news operations (most of the country) were doing the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not until I attended one of Jim Brown’s NIAR conferences did I realize what a limited practice CAR was. By that time I had left the newsroom for the academy. I had gone back to school in 1988 to earn a doctorate and to research the likely impact of digital information access and services on more traditional news media. Within the journalism educators’ association (AEJMC), I had become something of an advocate for CAR, especially for doing online research for news stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was often discouraging work. I organized a panel at Boston in 1991 that included Jim Brown of Indianapolis, Dorothy Bowles of Knoxville, folks from
  <em>
   The Boston Globe
  </em>
  , and others. At the appointed hour, our panelists outnumbered our audience. I had similarly discouraging experiences with educators well into 1992.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the fall of 1992,1 wrote an article in an academic newsletter in which I cited and played off an article that Tom Johnson had written for
  <em>
   Quill
  </em>
  magazine. Using Johnson’s arguments, I asked journalism professors to respond to the charge that journalism programs failing to teach the entire range of CAR were committing fraud upon their clientele. I included my e-mail address and other contact information. A good number of folks responded -most of them agreeing that universities should be teaching CAR. Many of those, however, asked, “But who is going to teach the teachers?” The answers started coming in 1993.
 </p>
 <p>
  Encouraged by this response, I organized for the 1993 AEJMC convention in Kansas City one “last” set of panels for journalism professors. Scheduled back-to-back during a four-hour block through the heart of the convention, these panels on doing online research attracted more than 200 attendees. One of the panels dealt with commercial databases (such as Lexis-Nexis and Dialog), and one of the panels discussed the Internet. Both sessions were “sold out,” and it was clear that we had finally caught
