  Reflections of a One-Eyed Man
 </h3>

  There was a time - it really wasn’t too many years ago - when I began to have a vision of the future. Reporters could just sit down at their computers, pull up a trove of useful information, and use it, not just to produce big investigative projects, but to make every story better than it would have been otherwise. As it turns out, the future is now. The bottomless hole of information is the World Wide Web. And the web isn’t just a research tool; it’s an unparalleled way of delivering deep, rich data to our readers. So why isn’t our journalism better? And why haven’t we done a better job of getting actionable information into the hands of the public?
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t mean to denigrate the fine, fine journalism produced every day in newspapers (and TV stations and even some websites). And I don’t doubt the impact that computer assisted reporting has had on newsrooms large and small. Though I’ve been out of the world of reporting for more than three years now, I still subscribe to the NICAR listserv. I am frequently struck by the sophistication of the dialogue, by the wide range of news organizations doing solid computer assisted reporting work, and by the huge distance that CAR has come since I took my first steps a dozen years ago. There was a time - again, not too many years back - when I felt I knew more about CAR than all but a handful of journalists in America. Now I feel far, far behind the curve.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also feel partly responsible that the two papers where I earned my CAR stripes - the
  <em>
   Palm Beach Post
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Miami Herald -
  </em>
  have not become the well-oiled analytical machines that I once envisioned. In the end, I and my fellow advocates for computer assisted reporting still haven’t fundamentally changed the way most of our newsrooms approach the process of gathering and making sense out of information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, many papers now have a data “guru” who helps produce big projects and also frequently (more frequently than management realizes) helps other reporters do a better job on their stories. And yes, some newspapers have a library/research staff that provides the range of services needed by a newsroom staff: from training to acquiring and maintaining databases to conducting research on a reporter’s behalf. But you could still fire a spreadsheet through a crowded newsroom and not hit anyone who knew what to do with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  My personal experience with computers goes back to my college days at the University of Pennsylvania. I was a history major who spent most of my days (and nights) at the offices of the
  <em>
   Daily Pennsylvanian,
  </em>
  but I did manage to attend most of my classes. And I had a broader range of interests than most of my liberal arts colleagues, perhaps because I’d always had an aptitude for, and interest in, numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  So I took an introductory programming course at Penn, based on a now-obscure language called APL (which supposedly stood for “A Programming Language” - those computer programmers have such a sense of humor!).
 </p>
 <p>
  I did well in the class, and enjoyed it immensely. So I decided to try a second-level programming course in the engineering
 </p>
 <p>
  school and came closer to failing that course than any other I took at Penn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eight years or so later, I found myself at the
  <em>
   Richmond Times-Dispatch,
  </em>
  embarking on a project looking at the impact of population growth on the state of Virginia. One of the first things I did was pull population statistics for every county and city in Virginia going back to the turn of the century. To put Virginia in perspective, I also found population figures for every U.S. state for the same time period. Of course, I wanted to figure out where the greatest growth had occurred. I knew there had to be an easier way than a calculator and a legal pad, so I asked one of the newsroom systems editors if he had any ideas. “Lotus 1-2-3,” he said. And I was off to the races. He already had it on his PC (he was one of the few in the newsroom who even had a PC at his desk), and he didn’t come in until 3 p.m., so I could bang away at his desk all morning and most of the afternoon. Of course, I had to type in all the numbers myself, but it was worth it when I saw how easy it was to analyze the population trends.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I arrived a couple of years later at the
  <em>
   Palm Beach Post,
  </em>
  I found other opportunities to apply my number-crunching interests, not to mention my typing skills. We looked at county commissioners’ cellular phone bills, bridge inspection data, nuclear plant performance records, campaign contributions. In each case, we typed the numbers into the computer by hand and went to work.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next pivotal moment was “The Color of Money,” the
  <em>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s
  </em>
  examination of bank home mortgage lending patterns. The
  <em>
   Post,
  </em>
  like the Atlanta paper, was (and is) owned by Cox Communications. Cox sent Dwight Morris, who did the number-crunching for the mortgage project, to the
  <em>
   Post
  </em>
  to give a seminar on CAR and give us a jump-start. To be honest, his advice wasn’t much help - Dwight did all his work on a mainframe using SPSS - but his attitude and rigorous approach were inspiring. (See Morris’s essay on page 35.)

  Somehow, I learned about the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting, and was able to get a space in Elliot Jaspin’s first class. I came back singing the praises of 9-track tape drives and XDB database software. Fortunately for me, my colleagues at the
  <em>
   Post
  </em>
  talked me out of both of those. We were able to get 9-tracks run by the paper’s Information Systems department, and one of the newsroom systems guys talked me into using Paradox (which he’d already purchased) rather than XDB. And somewhat miraculously, I was able to persuade my bosses to give me an intern to help on CAR projects.
