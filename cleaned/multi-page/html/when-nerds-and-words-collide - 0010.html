  defined not by the computer, but by the application of social science research methods to reporting. Executive editor Lee Hills later wrote to me that the survey was an important factor in the decision of the Pulitzer jury to give the 1968 prize for general local reporting to the staff of the
  <em>
   Free Press.
  </em>
  The Kemer Commission called the survey one of the few “brilliant exceptions” to the generally dismal performance of the news media in covering riots.
 </p>
 <p>
  While based in Washington, I became a roving local reporter, helping members of Knight’s then-small group of newspapers with stories, mostly relating to the civil rights and anti-war movements, that needed bigger investigative power than conventional methods could muster.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first description of this as computer reporting that I can remember was when a
  <em>
   Newsweek
  </em>
  profile in 1968 called me “a computer reporter.” The application of social science research methods was too complicated a frame. Computers were familiar, in concept if not in general use, and so that became the popular definition of what I was doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  By this time, I was writing my own programs in Data-Text. Harvard had produced the software on a government grant and placed it in the public domain. I bought it for $10, the price of the 7-track tape. And I located several computer centers that offered 7090 or 7094 time at cut rates while the 360 generation of machines was capturing market share. My statistical skills increased. For a 1968 study of black attitudes in Miami, I used factor analysis to sort out the varieties of black militancy with guidance from CNN’s Bill Schneider, then a Harvard graduate student.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the 1969-1970 academic year, I took a leave of absence from Knight to write
  <em>
   Precision Journalism
  </em>
  with money from and under the watchful eye of The Russell Sage Foundation. The book covered polls, field experiments, and analysis of public records. The title was suggested by Everett Dennis, who had coined the expression to contrast with “the new journalism” being practiced by those who applied fiction techniques to reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  That led to another error in framing. Because my most visible work had been with various forms of survey research, precision journalism became identified primarily with polls. While more accurate than the computer frame, it still did not capture the broad sweep of the concept as described in the first chapter of the first edition of
  <em>
   Precision Journalism.
  </em>
  Polls, when done correctly, are part of scientific method, but the concept is meant to
 </p>
 <p>
  cover all applicable forms of scientific method, including public records and experiments.
 </p>
 <p>
  My first public records application came in 1972 when I took time out from election coverage to help Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele with their criminal justice investigation.
  <em>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer
  </em>
  was by then a Knight newspaper, and I worked out a coding scheme and rudimentary sample design, then wrote the analysis program in Data-Text. By that time, IBM 7090 cost was down to $75 per hour - by the wall clock, not CPU time - and the three of us did the analytic work at a private computer center in suburban Maryland. In the tabloid reprint of their story (although not in the newspaper), Barlett and Steele included a sidebar crediting me with a “sophisticated computer analysis.” The criteria for distinguishing it from an unsophisticated computer analysis was not defined, but, once again, the computer was used to define the work. My field experiments came much later, after I switched to journalism education. At the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, I have sent student reporters into the field to measure the courtesy of motorists, the racial prejudice of pedestrians, underage alcohol sales, and the knowledge of pharmacists about the AIDS protection capabilities of different brands of condoms. In each case, we used computers without feeling the need to mention it.
 </p>
 <p>
  To emphasize that what I was doing was social science as well as journalism, I did two things. I archived data, starting with the Detroit riot survey, with the Institute for Research in Social Science at Chapel Hill to make it available for secondary analysis by scholars and graduate students. And I found opportunities for my own scholarly publishing, starting with a reworking of my Miami civil rights stories for
  <em>
   Public Opinion Quarterly
  </em>
  (33:2 1969).
 </p>
 <p>
  After three decades, the time has come to move away from the CAR frame and toward a social science frame. I don’t know what label to substitute for CAR. “Precision journalism” sounds dated. We need something that captures the notion in a fresh way. As reporters, we seek to draw generalizations that have more power than anecdotes or casual interviewing. “Scientific journalism,” which is how one French translation of “precision journalism” comes out, sounds too pretentious.

  Whatever the new term, let’s give up on CAR. Computers are used in so many different ways, even in the newsroom, that it no longer defines us, if it ever did. The time has come to declare CAR victorious and move on to a fresher, more ambitious concept. We need it, and so does the world.
