  lead, and how to find a detail in a police report. They learned these skills on routine stories, covering small city budgets, flower shows, and Saturday cops shifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, many journalists struggle with writing, interviewing, documents reporting, and news judgment their entire careers. These skills, which form the backbone of what many of us call journalism, take a lifetime of work. Experience counts.
 </p>
 <p>
  But we seem to think we can add a skill - the effective use of electronic records - in a few days. And if the training doesn’t result in a major project produced more quickly than with traditional tools of the trade, it’s been a waste.
 </p>
 <p>
  This seems to me to be the opposite of the way it ought to be viewed, and I think computer assisted reporting specialists can help make that transition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, we ought to warn editors and reporters, reminding them how many times they had to call back a source to get a detail they’d forgotten - an age, an address, or a make of a car-before it became second nature to ask the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  We can do more to build computer assisted reporting into routine work, as well. When I go on the road, I recommend that many reporters - particularly the most talented ones, who are most anxious about the payoff - use a spreadsheet or database to help them with work they’re already doing. They might type notes of a long court case into the spreadsheet, and let it generate the chronology they need to help tell the story. Or at least acquire a database that contains more words than numbers, or more anecdotes than data.
 </p>
 <p>
  That way, they’ll have the skills, and understand the risks, when it comes time to work on the project.

  CAR as online research
 </h4>
 <p>
  Clearly, the explosion of material on the Internet, and the growth of other online tools, has helped spread the understanding of the power of databases in reporting. These are nothing but large, sometimes unstructured, databases.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s also a downside to the Internet explosion. Many reporters continue to believe that every fact or anecdote they need is on the Internet, and there’s no need to learn other skills. And others are framing the Internet as the “news” tool, with spreadsheets, databases, and even mapping programs as the “extras.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Many participants in IRE workshops are shocked to find out that their local payroll isn’t on the Internet. Or that they can’t fully background a person for free using the World Wide Web. Or that the search engines on government websites often miss the most useful material. Or that searching databases on the Internet usually produces a report to print, not a data set to mine even deeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  The confusion between online tools and other tools is leading a generation of reporters to think there is nothing left to learn. They’re wrong, and their reporting will reflect that mistaken view.
 </p>

  Public records obstacles
 </h4>
 <p>
  Of course, threats to paper public records are emerging everywhere, and privatization of government tasks is making this more difficult. Some states remain easier than others. And as a
 </p>
 <p>
  handful of tests around the nation shows, public officials often ignore the open records laws already on the books.
 </p>
 <p>
  But obtaining electronic records adds a level of complexity, and a wait, that many reporters and their editors find unacceptable.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is where CAR experts can help the most.
 </p>
 <p>
  But overcoming the public records threat requires they become fully integrated into newsroom rites they have so far avoided - story planning sessions, budget meetings, and even editor conferences. It also requires that editors and other newsroom managers understand that they may not get records tomorrow. But they may have them next time the story emerges.
 </p>
 <p>
  These four factors have not just hindered the integration of computer assisted reporting in the newsroom. Some managers believe that, in fact, it’s as integrated as it ought to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I believe these managers have set up another false choice
 </p>
 <p>
  -    one that computer assisted reporting experts have more power to change than any other. That is, the choice between becoming immersed in data and immersed in journalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, though, the promise. Years ago, many observers claimed there would come a day when computer assisted reporting experts no longer existed. Instead of the expert in the comer, they argued, everyone would share in the skills and use them as needed for stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Very soon, in fact, reporters ought to have no excuse for an inability to download a report from the Internet and sort it to help find news. And very soon, reporters ought to be able to search a database of public records for the telling tip or the perfect interview subject. They ought to seek out databases that will help them with routine daily stories along with new projects. In fact, I would argue that in many newsrooms, there is no excuse
  <em>
   now.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  But knowing what other databases exist, hacking through the bureaucratic doublespeak that still surrounds most local and state public records databases, and getting them into useful shape is a task that most reporters will rarely need. These skills are also the most difficult. There’s no reason that everyone need go through that pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  I do think computer assisted reporting experts must define then
 </p>
 <p>
  The first is that of a reporter - either alone or as part of a team
 </p>
 <p>
  -    who shepherds a story through the reporting process, harnessing every resource and conducting original research. This is documents reporting at perhaps its highest level, the precision journalism that Phil Meyer describes. It adheres to the strictest of journalistic standards. And it follows precepts in reporting outlined by such traditional editors as Bob Greene of
  <em>
   Newsday
  </em>
  and John Ullman, author of
  <em>
   The Reporter’s Handbook.

  The second is one of an editor. In fact, I believe this role is closer to a writing coach or a projects editor who scans the newsroom for the stories with the greatest potential. Make no mistake, though: This is a management job, and reporters who choose this role on a story oughtn’t be concerned with bylines. Their editors aren’t. They ought to be concerned with helping reporters get the most out of their own stories, not writing stories or doing the research for them.
