  Project ideas

 <p>
  In the discussions that followed from this inventory of issues, six priority projects were proposed. These were:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Help the assigning/line editors help us:
  </strong>
  The most essential person to journalists working on CAR projects is their editor, but too often the editor doesn’t know much about these techniques. An editor can help reporters who are using traditional reporting techniques; an editor knows how to question a journalist who had interviewed a person, but not one who has interviewed data. Editors need some help.
 </p>
 <p>
  IDEA: Write a handbook, “What Every Editor Needs to Know About CAR,” focusing not on the technical aspects but the practical questions they should know to ask.

  Data access is the make or break point for CAR work. Negotiating the acquisition of records, understanding the pitfalls of using the records, developing ideas for reporting from the records, and making access to the information in the records available to other journalists are the challenges. In newsrooms all around the country, journalists have negotiated for records and figured out how to make it easier for others to use them. We’d like to gather information on those records, how much they cost, what was involved in getting them, and how they are being used.
 </p>
 <p>
  IDEA: Create a database of databases to which individual newsrooms can contribute. This could be an internal record-
