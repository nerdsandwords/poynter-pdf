  A few problems
 </h4>
 <p>
  A real problem that we have found is that in many newsrooms, when owners or managers make an effort to acquire modem equipment, reporters often resist the necessary training either due to fear of technology or because they think their time is too “valuable” to squander in computing lessons.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have seen too many newsrooms in which modem computers are reduced to glorified word processors, while the reporter doesn’t suspect the hidden resources that might be found in that unopened Microsoft Office folder. They find it easier to get help at their paper’s library or information center, if it has one, or to base their stories solely on readily available documents such as official press releases.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, most media show little interest in investing in training for their reporters in CAR techniques. Their leitmotif is the recurring economic crisis, while in reality many of the owners and publishers in the region are still not convinced of the profitability of CAR and other modem journalistic resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are, however, some impressive cases, such as
  <em>
   Folha cle Sao Paulo,
  </em>
  which sponsors an extraordinary training program both for its staff and for young men and women fresh out of journalism school and other fields.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are also absurd situations, as when a daily from northern Mexico hired us to conduct an Internet workshop for its newsroom. After two days of demonstrating search methods, useful sites, and reporting techniques, we asked the class members to talk about how they used the web. “We don’t,” they answered. “Our management decided that it’s a waste of time and money and suspended all our accounts.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We have encountered other pitfalls. For example, some colleagues have shown such enthusiasm about information obtained on the Internet or the hard data they run through spreadsheets or database managers that they seem to forego
 </p>
 <p>
  traditional reporting, that is, the need to turn that information into an interesting story. We often read stories that are nothing more than a few dry paragraphs surrounded by tables and graphics, or failed stories that run out of steam three lines after the lead.
 </p>
 <p>
  This, we are sure, is something that will progressively disappear as the novelty of these techniques wears off among reporters and the public, and especially when data-dazzled editors pick up their pencils and start doing their jobs again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another related problem, which might be more troublesome because it can misinform readers, is that some colleagues who discover CAR don’t have a proper knowledge of the field they cover or even basic statistical training.
 </p>
 <p>
  The increasing “friendliness” of Excel and Access, for example, can lead them to manipulate data incorrectly and reach unwarranted or even wrong conclusions that might then be printed as news.
 </p>
 <p>
  We trust that these and other problems will be the exception as Latin American journalism develops more savvy reporters and, of course, readers. Also helpful in this process will be the expanding network of CAR pioneers who, as they refine their methodologies and broaden their knowledge, can share them with colleagues who have just arrived on the scene. This has happened in countries such as the United States with the collaboration of IRE and NICAR.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lastly, it is common in this part of the world, as elsewhere, for many newly graduated journalists to dream of becoming the latest stars of investigative journalism. And, as elsewhere, vacancies are scarce.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if more young journalists acquire and apply CAR skills to their daily reporting, the quality of Latin American journalism in general will improve, and perhaps we’ll finally overcome that old debate about whether investigative journalism is a specialty in itself or if, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez insists, it is a redundant expression.
