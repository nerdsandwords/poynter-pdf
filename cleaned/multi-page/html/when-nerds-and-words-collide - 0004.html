  This book of readings is dedicated to all the journalists in newsrooms who have struggled and strived to use the computer’s power in the powerful reporting. The stories told here reflect - and honor - your stories. It is by your example that the promise of computer assisted reporting will be realized in newsrooms everywhere.

  In addition, I’d like to thank Publications Manager Billie Keirstead and copy editor Vicki Krueger for their excellent editing work, under an intense deadline. They were able to take these different voices and create a beautiful chorus.
