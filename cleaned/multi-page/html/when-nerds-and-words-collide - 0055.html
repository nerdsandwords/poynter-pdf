  PC- and Mac-based systems, others still are on legacy front-end systems, with only one or two PCs in a corner on which to do CAR work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Internet access in too many newsrooms is still through America Online and a slow modem. This is true even in some newsrooms with new PC- or Mac-based systems. The issue usually is one of cost for a T-1 line or ISDN access and a firewall server, but in some cases it’s also based on systems personnel not wanting to do the work required to install or support the systems. Unfortunately they often are able to convince computer-ignorant publishers that aliens will invade the newspaper if Internet access is allowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I do believe this will change - albeit slowly - not because reporters need web access but because those on the revenue side of the operation need access. As more newspapers produce more web products, advertising sales reps need to sell for that medium - and they can’t sell advertising for websites if they’ve never used, or don’t have access to, the web. If that improves Internet-access capabilities for our newsrooms, who cares how it happens?
 </p>
 <p>
  I have spent a lot of time talking - and listening - to our newspapers’ systems managers. I think it’s important to be non-combative and to understand their concerns. But I am firm in my message that the Internet is an important tool that they have to find a way to provide access to. By the same token, I talk to our editors about teaching safe surfing and responsibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cost also is a factor. Despite the fact that NICAR conference registration is low (and we even provided meals during our regional training sessions), some newspapers are unable (or unwilling) to pay transportation and hotel costs for trainees.
 </p>
 <p>
  One solution might be online training or interactive learning programs, such as the one provided by the American Press Institute.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the spring of 1997, Neill Borowski of
  <em>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer
  </em>
  and I participated in the API pilot project to develop the institute’s interactive learning program for CAR. While interactive learning is not as good as a classroom environment, it is a solution for newsrooms strapped for training dollars (although I think the API tuition of nearly $600 still is too high).
 </p>
 <p>
  Over a six-week period, we taught a combined class of 24 students CAR concepts, how to use the Internet and the web, where to find data, how to develop stories, etc. Because we did not have the capability of teaching spreadsheet and database software online, we initially did not include that in the course. However, it became clear that the students wanted those skills, and so I taught both in a “chat” environment. (And I am thankful
 </p>
 <p>
  to this day for Windows’ programs cut-and-paste capabilities that allowed me to do this!)
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike a classroom situation in which the audience is captive, there are problems with an interactive learning environment. Students drop out because they are involved in a breaking news story at their newspapers. If they miss a week, they feel they can’t catch up, and so they don’t come back, despite the fact that we broke down the components so that one week was not dependent on the next. Some supervising editors also didn’t build in time during the normal workday for staffers to work on our assignments or to participate in scheduled “chats” (a vehicle we found to be particularly useful in the CAR course).
 </p>
 <p>
  All that said, I do think that interactive learning is a useful alternative to classroom or workshop training when money is a factor. It was very rewarding to see some of our students (none of whom had been exposed to CAR before our course) produce stories using the CAR skills they had learned in our course.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s also the issue of training at the university level. I sit on the advisory council for the University of Florida College of Journalism, and have been pushing the college to provide a CAR course for several years. Three years ago, the college started offering a class taught on an adjunct basis. (Debbie Wolfe of the
  <em>
   St. Petersburg Times
  </em>
  taught it one semester. See her essay on page 51.) Because of its location, finding adjuncts willing to come to Gainesville even one day a week is much more difficult than it is at universities in larger cities (such as Temple, where Borowski teaches on an adjunct basis).
 </p>
 <p>
  Ideally, of course, colleges of journalism should have fulltime faculty teaching a CAR class every semester. But college professors (Phil Meyer and John Ullman aside) don’t get the training for the same reasons that many of our reporters and editors don’t get it.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, professors sometimes are reluctant to add to their teaching load. Some of this is justified in the case of professors with heavy teaching loads; some of it is not. It’s also no secret that many college professors haven’t been in a newsroom for years and are still teaching their classes with the same syllabus they used 20 years ago. Nevertheless, I think we have to keep pushing our colleges and universities to teach CAR skills - and eventually to build it into then
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the obstacles, I am not discouraged. I have seen great strides made in CAR training - and the results of that training -in the past five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I use myself as an example. If a middle-aged woman who never touched a computer until
  10
  years ago can leant this stuff, anyone can.
