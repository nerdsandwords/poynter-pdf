  A Beginning Educational Effort
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   By James W. Brown

  The 1980s were characterized by a maturing of the desktop micro-computer. The Apple computer of the late 1970s, with the sloping front that looked like an amphibious landing vehicle, when paired with VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet, made inroads in the business world - especially small businesses. IBM, finally taking notice of micro-computing, introduced its first desktop model. That machine was my first personal computer. Buying hardware and software in the early 1980s was like being set afloat in the north woods of Canada in a leaky canoe, with broken paddles, and no food, matches, map, or GPS unit. You had to survive with your own wit and resources. If you were able to actually do something with a computer, you were deemed a “guru” or “nerd” by all who knew you. Computer stores were populated by salespeople who did not know anything about what they were selling. If you needed a connecting cable, you often had to make it. Software manuals were often mimeographed and were poorly written by the software designers and programmers.
 </p>
 <p>
  That state of affairs was not all bad. Struggling through adversity teaches self-reliance. The poor quality of documentation led to a third-party industry of computer books. The success of the third-party book publishers encouraged more people to learn about computers, and so on. Early adopters were eager to help and support others seeking to learn. New “online communities” emerged. Networks of computer bulletin boards became popular venues for sharing knowledge and “shareware” software.

  Schneider arrives in a whirlwind
 </h4>
 <p>
  In 1989, Andy Schneider became the Indiana University School of Journalism’s first occupant of the Riley Chair, a rotating chair that brings distinguished professionals to IU for shortterm appointments. Unlike his successors, Schneider decided to work on the Indianapolis campus rather than on the larger and older campus in Bloomington. That gave a tremendous boost to our young program and put the two of us in a direct working relationship.
 </p>
 <p>
  The partnership was good for both of us. Our skills and interests complemented one another. In 1986 and 1987, Schneider was the lead reporter in projects that won back-to-back Pulitzer Prizes for public service and specialized reporting. He is a terrific journalist, but dealing with software and hardware problems was frustrating to him. Even though Schneider had used computers in more than half the stories he reported between 1986 and 1990, he wrote, “I don’t really like computers. In fact, there are times when I absolutely hate the things.”

 <p>
  While a candidate for a master’s degree in business administration at Indiana University, I learned every nuance of the 80-column Hollerith punch card - which was based on technology used to tabulate the 1890 U.S. census. I could punch, sort, and submit them to the mainframe computers.
 </p>
 <p>
  error. You stood in line for the next available card punch machine, corrected the necessary cards, and resubmitted the deck. I spent too many hours punching those damn cards. Most of my programs were written in FORTRAN, and most everything I needed to do required an original program.

  National Institute for Advanced Reporting

  The computer problems that made smoke rise from Schneider’s ears were interesting problems to me. We were super-additive troublemakers. We both knew computers were, even then, powerful tools. We noted that not many reporters

  Steele, with Phil Meyer’s assistance, and others that followed. We decided to try to do something to educate journalists about this new tool. We formed the National Institute for Advanced Reporting (NIAR) and scheduled our first national conference for the spring of 1990 on the Indianapolis campus. About 400 reporters and editors from across the nation and four foreign countries came to the “Conference on Advanced Investigative Methods for Journalists,” which apparently was the first for working journalists.
 </p>
 <p>
  Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) were co-sponsors of the first two conferences. IRE president Rick Tulsky wrote to introduce the 1990 conference, “The use of computers in research is an area that too few of us have mastered; hopefully, we will leave this weekend with more of us inclined to make use of the computer as a journalistic tool.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ideas from that conference became models for professional training later used by the IRE National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was common for editors to believe that computers for newsgathering would be much more expensive than they actually were. Some editors estimated that they would have to spend $10,000 or more to get a computer suitable for a reporter to use. Even in 1990, this was not the case. David Ashenfelter, of the

  </em>
  did complex projects on an almost obsolete 10-year-old Kaypro.

  In 1990, journalists in software training sessions did not know where the computer’s power switch was. Four years later, some of those same journalists were asking for sessions on Statistical

   With Andy Schneider, he formed the National Institute for Advanced Reporting in 1989 and offered the first professional education conferences on computer analysis as a reporting tool.

  A survey we conduted in September 1989 indicated fewer than 60 of the nation’s newsrooms were actively involved in using computers to gather and evaluate data for news stories.
