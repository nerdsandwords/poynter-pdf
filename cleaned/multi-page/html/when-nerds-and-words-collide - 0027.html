  For my first big project, I zeroed in on property assessments for a number of reasons. First, I figured that I would find something screwed up in the assessment system. In an area growing as rapidly as the

  </em>
  territory was, there just had to be inequities. Second, even if all I did was explain the system to people, I figured there would be interest in the story - everyone is interested in their taxes. We were able to prove conclusively that property assessments were inequitable for people owning less expensive homes. It was not really a surprising finding - other newspapers had found the same thing in their communities - but the story got a lot of attention.

  I didn’t realize how good I had it at the

  until I succumbed to a recruitment pitch from
  <em>
   The Miami Herald’s
  </em>
  Broward County edition. I went to a big-league paper in an ultra-competitive market, but I lost my intern, my supportive management, and my high-powered PC. The best computer in the office was an IBM 286 that was at least five years old. I became a big fan of Reflex, a DOS database manager that did truly remarkable things with little disk space or memory. With nothing more than that 286, Reflex, and Quattro Pro, we were able to do some good small-scale projects. And I also struck up a terrific relationship with Steve Doig, the
  <em>

  CAR guru. We looked at drunken driving convictions, population trends (the 1990 census came out while I was in Broward), campaign contributions, and more.

  In the early days of the popularization of CAR, there was something of a schism between the spreadsheet disciples and the database mavens. The dividing line roughly paralleled the division between day-to-day CAR and project-related CAR. My experience, coming to databases only after mastering spreadsheets, convinced me that spreadsheets were the most useful tool for the typical reporter, and that the greatest benefits of CAR didn’t show up in mega-projects but in basic beat reporting. After one or two of the NICAR conferences, I think most of us who were teaching CAR concluded that there was a happy marriage between the two. Spreadsheets were a terrific entry point, but databases offered the greatest potential impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, I think we have all been guilty of focusing on tools rather than on techniques. In order to convince others (and ourselves) that what we were doing had merit, we emphasized hardware and software rather than the analytical skills few journalists have mastered. When we named our field, we came up with a term (computer assisted reporting) that put the machine up front. I think we’d be better off using the much older term, popularized if not coined by Phil Meyer, of “precision journalism.” Because precision is what CAR is all about -moving away from “he said/she said” reporting and reaching the real, incontrovertible truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  From a distance, I see and read about newsrooms that seem to have made much progress toward the world of precision journalism, such as
  <em>
   The News &amp; Observer
  </em>
  in Raleigh, N.C., which has given its news researchers a lead role in information gathering and maintenance. Or
  <em>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer,
  </em>
  where Neill Borowski and Tom Torok have helped dozens of reporters produce outstanding work, and then published their databases to web servers for reporters and the general public to use. But these are the exceptions, I’m afraid, and even these CAR leaders
 </p>
 <p>
  would tell you there are still many, many reporters at their papers - and an even greater share of newsroom leaders - who just don’t understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, I think the cachet of CAR may have largely disappeared by now. We’re not going to change journalism by teaching every reporter to use Excel or Access. We need to get reporters to think differently, to approach information more analytically, to believe that you can find a kind of truth with numbers that you will never find in anecdotes or interviews. It will require a broad-based campaign, targeted at all levels of the newsroom. But for many of our colleagues, it is already too late. They got into this business because they liked to write, not crunch numbers. They liked talking to people, not seeking answers from a database. We’re going to need to focus even more attention on the new people coming into our business -high school and college students considering journalism as a career, but also being tempted by the higher salaries and greater sex appeal of other kinds of work.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got my opportunity in online publishing because everyone at the
  <em>
   Herald
  </em>
  - including me - thought the web represented the intersection of journalism and technology. My CAR experience had given me a reputation, among journalists, as a technology expert. It was my former colleague, Steve Doig, who told me that amounted to the old adage of being “a one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind.” The experience of managing our web operation truly opened my eyes to how little I knew about technology. I also discovered that successfully running an online publication has less to do with editorial content or technology than with managing people and understanding the world of advertising and marketing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I regret to say that the websites I oversee (
 </p>
 <p>
  The web is going to keep changing our industry - whether that means newsgathering in general, or newspapers more specifically. Our print “mother ships” are almost certainly going to become less profitable over time, as classified advertising moves from print to online. Occasionally I am asked what the future holds for newspaper reporters. What I tell them is that newspapers are most certainly going to change and may even disappear one day. But good reporters are going to be in ever greater demand. And I don’t mean the kind of reporters who publicize leaked information from special prosecutors or appear on Sunday morning talk shows. I mean journalists who can find truth where others rely on anecdote. Those who aren’t intimidated by numbers, but instead seek out data to confirm or reject the conventional wisdom. Those who have a “database state of mind.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In short, precision journalists.
