  equipped with something similar to the tools that I envisioned. The question for me was simply who would get to build those tools, and when. I realized that if I didnâ€™t give it a try, I would never forgive myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  So in late 1996,1 quit my job at the
  <em>
   Post-Dispatch
  </em>
  and started a little company called NewsEngin Inc. Two years later, News-Engin has a strong array of knowledge-management tools up and running in more than a dozen newsrooms across the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have a popular application called UniQuery that makes it easy for newsrooms to put relational databases on an intranet. UniQuery performs global searches, so that web users can type
 </p>
 <p>
  in a name or address and search every newsroom database with a single click. Hundreds of journalists are using our Source-Tracker software to build secure, fully searchable troves of contact information, interview notes, source documents, and stories. And more important, publishers have demonstrated a willingness to purchase and deploy these tools, especially when they come bundled with our versatile editorial front-end software (NewsFront, our Trojan horse for CAR).
 </p>
 <p>
  So as the millennium approaches and the CAR landscape continues to change, I find myself fortunate to be part of the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still the best job in journalism, hands down.
