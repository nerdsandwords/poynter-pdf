  The Education of a Computer Assisted Reporter
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   By Jim Heaney
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I was greatly influenced early in my career by Phil Meyer’s book
  <em>
   Precision Journalism
  </em>
  and its proposition that reporters needed to go beyond traditional reporting methods. Many reporters have been able to act on that vision through the rise of computer assisted reporting, although I don’t feel newspapers have done a particularly good job of seizing the opportunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got my first taste of CAR in 1986 when I covered transportation for
  <em>
   The Orlando Sentinel.
  </em>
  An upcoming referendum was seeking voter approval to establish a regional transportation agency, with taxing power, to build roads. Everyone knew traffic was bad and getting worse, but I wanted to document the problem and determine to what extent the road improvements proposed by the agency would alleviate congestion.
 </p>
 <p>
  I obtained data that showed the capacity and usage of all the roads that the new agency would have improved. Back then, few newsrooms had personal computers, and the
  <em>
   Sentinel
  </em>
  was no exception. I wound up using a PC in the market research department and got the staff to show me how to use the software. After days of inputting, I finally had useful data, which translated into good stories and graphics that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Demonstrating how badly congested the road system was didn’t do agency advocates any good - the proposal was trounced in referendum - but the exercise gave me a sense of the possibilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  I moved to
  <em>
   The Buffalo News
  </em>
  later that year and found much the same situation. The market research department, not the newsroom, had the PCs, so I made friends there, doing a variety of stories. I have always liked “compare and contrast” stories, and CAR allowed me to do them with a lot of material at my disposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the early 1990s I realized CAR was the wave of the future and set out to do a project that would force me to learn software and all the assorted ins and outs. It was time to cut the cord with the market research people, who had done their share of hand holding.
 </p>
 <p>
  I sold my editors on doing a series on slum housing in the city, which required building a database of all the code violators who had been prosecuted in city housing court. There was one problem, however. The courts had just started entering their housing records into a database the year before, and there wasn’t a sufficient record built yet. I shelved my series for a year and a half until there were three years of data.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that, my education began. I had to learn software. I learned of the perils of dirty data. I had people wondering what the hell Heaney was doing for all that time, playing with a computer but not producing stories. They soon found out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I produced a five-day series that identified the 12 worst slumlords in the city, pinpointed the streets with the worst housing, and detailed the total impotence of the housing court. The power of the series rested in the detail I was able to produce through my computer analysis. I was able to deliver the goods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The series sold my editors on the promise of CAR, and other reporters at the paper starting following suit.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the mid-1990s I tackled Buffalo’s public school system, taking over the beat and producing an eight-day series assessing the condition of the system. As a part of my reporting, I collaborated with a team of local university professors to build and analyze student demographic and testing data.
 </p>
 <p>
  I struggled with the same kinds of issues I did with the slumlord project - having to learn yet another software package, cleaning up dirty data, and, most of all, hying not to be overwhelmed by all the information. I went home with my brain fried more times than I care to remember.
 </p>
 <p>
  While I remain the beat reporter, I spend most of my time doing enterprise reporting, and I’ve found over the past couple of years that there are very few major stories for which I’m not tapping into a database or building a spreadsheet. CAR has made me more of a data-driven reporter than I used to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, I spend a lot of time doing traditional street reporting, dealing with sources, and spending time in the schools. CAR is no substitute for being there, and more than once I have found that the conclusions drawn from my tidy spreadsheets don’t pass the reality test.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll admit that I’ve blown hot and cold on CAR. Old habits, office politics, pressure to generate stories off my beat, and plain old burnout have proven to be disincentives at times. Having to learn new software (I think I’m on my fourth version) tends to get old, especially when you’re often left to learn it on your own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet I’ve come through the past 12 years convinced that any reporter worth a damn must master CAR techniques. When I speak to college journalism students, that’s usually one of the first points I make: Don’t graduate without learning a lot about using computers. My advice to uninitiated reporters is to find a story that will force them to learn the ropes. It’s easier to wade in through individual stories than to jump headfirst into a major project. I also encourage reporters to attend an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference to soak up ideas.

  I think newspapers have come a fair way in embracing CAR, but not nearly far enough. CAR remains too much of a bottom-up phenomenon, practiced by reporters with initiative and ignored by those without. Newsroom management usually says the right things, but few people in charge have actually done CAR journalism, and their support is too much in the abstract and short of absolute. And it shows in the haphazard way that CAR has been introduced at many newspapers.
