  Through self-preservation, though, some of these experts have leaned toward managing and maintaining databases for the newsroom, only to find that their job resembles a systems or library role rather than a reporting or editing role. I believe they need to back off that task, or shift their jobs into those departments. That’s because they’re setting up a support operation in the newsroom - one that’s needed and rewarding, but one that’s not reporting or editing.
 </p>
 <p>
  I realize their management may expect them to do these functions. I realize many experts become byte-heads out of self-preservation. And I realize they want to stay on the cutting edge. But running an intranet is not what anyone went into reporting to do. Putting databases on the web is a production job, not a journalistic job.
 </p>
 <p>
  If it’s what these experts
  <em>
   do
  </em>
  want to do, then they ought to realize that they’re no longer journalists in the sense that many
 </p>
 <p>
  people define the word. Pretending it is reporting or editing risks diluting the journalistic functions they do perform.
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of the solution comes from more informed management. And there’s evidence that a new generation of managers - not all of them young - will help smooth this transition. From Pat Stith in Raleigh, N.C., to Shawn McIntosh in Jackson, Miss., former computer assisted reporting experts are infiltrating the ranks of line management. That’s a partial solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest of the solution comes from within our own community - to better define what we do to more traditional managers, to educate our own editors.

  We should let go of functions that belong elsewhere in the newsroom, or move with them. And we should free the reporters in our newsrooms or ourselves to get back to the jobs we love the most - telling stories, understanding documents in any form, and following the story.
