  integrated with other subjects. Learning statistics goes hand in hand with learning spreadsheets; and browsing the web connects easily with news research, or writing a story about the latest election in Germany.
 </p>
 <p>
  Writing articles for newspapers and magazines is the core of practical training, which takes place in our second and third years. In order to teach the ways of publishing and news research, several online magazines are produced by students.
  <em>
   Media.nl
  </em>
  is a weekly about the latest developments in journalism and the media.
  <em>
   Euroviews
  </em>
  is a quarterly about Europe, and is based on students’ travel reports. Both magazines are text oriented, but in the coming months the first multimedia magazines will see the light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Theory and practice need to go hand in hand. A lecture series for second-year students offers reflections on developments in journalism and communications. We try to incorporate some form of online education in these lectures, using discussion platforms for students to talk with each other and with the speakers. At the end of the lecture series, students are asked to write a paper about the future of the profession.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of their studies, in the fourth year, students specialize in a beat and in a medium. Digital journalism is the youngest specialization. Among the elements are: news research using discussion lists and news groups; formulating detailed queries for search engines; knowledge about design and publishing on the web; writing for the Internet and using the interactive possibilities; and using spreadsheets and databases for reporting and research.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year’s students worked on a project about crime and police. They explored relationships between the crime rate in a police district and the money spent on the police force in that district. The facts were less clear than expected, but presenting these facts on digital maps was an enormous help for further analysis. This also provided a basis for the reporting about the work of the police in certain districts.
 </p>
 <p>
  After they finish the specialized study and production, students in digital journalism work at online sections of newspapers and magazines as interns. They are successful and seem to fit right in. The demand for these students, however, is greater than the supply. This is a good opportunity for the future.

  Journalists and the digital newsroom
 </h4>
 <p>
  In one of my training sessions for worldng journalists, an older journalist took the mouse from the desk, directed it toward the screen like a remote control, furiously pressed one of the buttons, and shouted, “It doesn’t work!” A few weeks later I met him again at his desk in the newsroom. Since that session, he had created his own home page, and he was working on a story about the eruption of a volcano using a lot of online sources. Older journalists are not necessary outdated and old-fashioned; some learn very quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most newsrooms are replacing their old systems with PCs, offering software ranging from word processing to databases and spreadsheets. The Internet is a few keystrokes away, while the newsroom generally has its own network with an Internet connection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, these journalists need to be trained. Explaining and understanding research on the Internet is not difficult. The problem is learning to handle the abundance of sources on the Internet. Stielstra discovered that “the Internet is growing fast and therefore as the number of hits increases, one needs to be very specific in queries. However, search engines try to address the general user, so the outcome of general search engines for journalists is often disappointing.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally determining the reliability of sources on the Internet strikes the working journalist as a big problem. Of course the reliability of the information is determined by the source, but how do journalists check information from newsgroups and discussions lists? This is a much-discussed issue during training sessions.
 </p>

  The future
 </h4>
 <p>
  How did TV or radio look 10 years after they were introduced? Computer assisted journalism is looking good after 10 years. Of course, we are waiting for more bandwidth and faster computers in order to have real multimedia productions. But CAR has lots of prospects.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tools available to journalists are growing. A laptop including a camera and a microphone will become standard equipment. Journalists will edit and produce the items on the spot and send them over a network to a central desk where the decision will be made where and how these items will be published.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, journalists have new tools to do some investigative reporting. Spreadsheets and databases to analyze public records are now being discovered. Dick van Eijk of
  <em>
   NRC Han-delsblad
  </em>
  recently published a magnificent story about rich and poor neighborhoods in Dutch cities, using advanced spreadsheets and digital mapping.
 </p>
 <p>
  The profession will be enriched with new jobs related to journalism, such as system editor, webmaster, and researcher. Classical journalism education needs to be enhanced with Information Technology (IT). And other IT specialists need to have at least some journalistic training in order to work with journalists.
 </p>
 <p>
  The digital revolution will end the distinctions among radio, television, and newspaper journalists. The development toward new multimedia news products will force journalists to be educated in all the media, in order to switch from radio to video or text.
 </p>
 <p>
  The aim of all journalism is to inform the public. An important question is whether this new technology has something to add. A clear answer has not been found. The new media are gaining acceptance; but how much can you leam from zapping over web pages? And finally there is government, experimenting with a new electronic democracy for which an electronic, informed public is prerequisite.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is safe to conclude that technological development influences the changes in communication and journalism toward digital journalism. But this process of change in the past 10 years has hardly been controlled; it just happened. It is time that some reflection starts about the goals we have for this change: informing the public and improving the realization of our democratic ideas.
