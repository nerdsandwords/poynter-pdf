  Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Mike Berens, of the
  <em>
   Chicago Tribune,
  </em>
  is an example of the positive influence of the conferences. He progressed from learner to trainer, leading practitioner, main session speaker, and international trainer. (See Berens’s essay on page 14.)

  In the spring of 1990, Schneider and I offered Indiana University’s first course in computer assisted reporting. Two-thirds of the students were working TV and newspaper reporters. Each week we were astounded at the new applications those students found for newsgathering. One project on medical malpractice that grew out of the course won the Pulitzer Prize for Joe Halli-nan and Susan Heddon of
  <em>
   The Indianapolis Star.
  </em>
  That wasn’t bad for the first offering of a new course.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the 1990 conference, Schneider went back to the world of journalism. The NIAR staff continued to host five more conferences, which put an increasing dent in the small academic budget of the School of Journalism at Indianapolis. In the meantime, Brant Houston had built an excellent infrastructure and staff at NICAR. They offered boot camps of weeklong immersion compared with our two and half days of basic introduction. While something of a competitive nature emerged between NIAR and NICAR in the early days, we evolved into a cooperative and supportive venture. Indeed, Houston and his staff were very helpful to us in conducting our last several conferences.
 </p>
 <p>
  The work and worry associated with preparation for a technology-rich conference is immense. The small NIAR staff was exhausted after the six conferences. Faced with the certain resignation of 100 percent of my staff if I proposed to host a seventh conference, I decided six was enough.

  Concerns for the future
 </h4>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Newspapers:
  </strong>
  I have not, over the years, noticed any great concern on the part of newspaper management to further the intellectual development of their employees. This may sound harsh, but I know of too many examples that give evidence to the contrary. Many reporters attending our conference not only paid their own way but had to take vacation time as well. I find this situation outrageous. It seems reporters are treated much more as production line workers than educated professionals. But even that analogy fails because I know that coiporations spend a great deal of money training production line workers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Newspaper management needs a paradigm shift or a swift kick in the pants. News organizations need to start encouraging professional education. Reporter education and support is an investment to ensure continued importance of newsgathering in our democracy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Television:
  </strong>
  Newton Minnow really did peg the industry correctly in the 1960s when he termed television a vast wasteland. Very few reporters of substance exist in television. Television, as an industry, does not provide paid student internships, nor does the industry supply college scholarships. They get what they pay for. While there are exceptions, not much of substance has been done with computers as a reporting tool. Stations are more likely to spend money on double Doppler radar than on support for reporting. While weather forecasting has improved, the quality of
 </p>
 <p>
  reporting has declined since the early days of television.
 </p>
 <p>
  TV managers need to think seriously about whether they have the will to produce anything beyond entertainment. Television used to inform us about important issues. What happened and what can they do with the time Seinfeld has vacated?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Higher education:
  </strong>
  Curricula do not change rapidly. Political processes and factions on many faculties rival that of Congress in an impeachment trial. A convincing case for change is not made overnight. As journalism schools have evolved from having trade-school reputations that were not respected by other faculty in the university, there has been a growing slight of tool skills in favor of courses that fit more squarely into the university fabric. Faculty reward structures do not typically reinforce learning new skills and teaching them. Most faculty were practicing journalists when CAR was something you drive. Faculty don’t teach what they don’t know. And so it goes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hope that CAR training will become a required experience for all journalism students everywhere. It may take awhile to get there, although clearly progress has been made. I have noticed that basic training in spreadsheets and relational databases is very commonly available in other majors. Thus, journalism students are likely to be exposed to basic tool skills somewhere in their education, if not in the journalism major.
 </p>
 <p>
  But training in the journalism major can bring many elements together so they make sense. Software training is not sufficient. Formulating the problem is much more important. Teaching the mechanical basics of SPSS is trivial and doesn’t take much time. Knowing which statistic to use with a particular data set is the real problem. SPSS is useless without a background in statistics.
 </p>
 <p>
  I consulted with a journalist on a problem that had become worrisome to him. He was concerned with a 90-year-old truck driver who was considerably older than the other drivers in the sample. He wondered whether the age had been incorrectly entered in the database he had obtained. He was worried that this “outlier” would skew the mean age of the sample. I asked how big the sample was. He said 105,000 drivers. He had not yet reasoned the effect of one person on the mean age in a sample of 105,000 persons is very, very insignificant. In other words, a little knowledge can be dangerous - or at least worrisome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Statistics, taught with journalism examples and integrated with CAR techniques, is best done in journalism school. CAR is no less important a skill than interviewing, writing, layout, design, visual communication and so on. We don’t need to eliminate core courses. CAR can be effectively integrated in almost any course.
 </p>
 <p>
  The important link is for the faculty to recognize its importance and to acquire the experience to teach it. These are basic tools to try to make sense of things. I will always be perplexed that journalism schools did not provide leadership in integrating analysis techniques into the curriculum. Business schools did. And they grew from “trade-school” reputations as well.

  IRE/NICAR continues the professional education effort. I expect no drop in the need for education in the next decade. Thinking about numbers and what they mean should become as much a part of journalists minds as concern for words and what they mean. It is an achievable goal.
