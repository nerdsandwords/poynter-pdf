  I believe CAR should be introduced in newsrooms in a very methodical, systematic way. Beats should be retrofit to incorporate CAR resources and techniques. Staff should receive all the necessary equipment and training. Staffing needs to be reconfigured. Editors have to gain a genuine appreciation of the potential of CAR and then hold reporters accountable for changing the way they do their jobs.
 </p>
 <p>
  I see some papers doing a decent job of this in some ways, but I don’t get the sense that anyone is doing CAR the way it ought to be done.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s a lot of CAR reporting done on projects and other non-deadline work, but I don’t see it woven into daily coverage to the extent it should. I think we’ve come up particularly short when it comes to using CAR to help put stories in context, particularly when it comes to crime. And be it daily or enterprise, I don’t think we’ve been especially inventive when it comes to story ideas.
 </p>
 <p>
  In short, we’re light years behind a lot of industries when it comes to applying technology, and while we’re making up ground, the pace isn’t quick enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think a couple of groups, The Poynter Institute and especially IRE, have done much to spread the word. I envision a larger role for them in the future, if they are so inclined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Too many reporters, too many papers, are trying to figure this out on their own. We need a collaborative effort to accelerate the mainstreaming of CAR. I’d like to see a core of experienced CAR practitioners, working under the flag of IRE, Poynter, or whomever, to work together to advance the cause in different ways than what’s been attempted to this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’d start by identifying the major beats that all newspapers cover and retrofitting them using CAR resources and techniques. I would develop a model that any newspaper, any reporter, could plug in to. What are the best online resources available? What
 </p>
 <p>
  sort of data are available from agencies and trade groups? Which listservs are worth joining? What are the obvious story ideas that can be pursued to get started? What sort of routines should a reporter get into? What sort of software should they know?
 </p>
 <p>
  With this framework developed, individual reporters could customize their approach to the particulars of their situation. A transportation reporter in a city with a hub airport, for example, might want to focus more on aviation resources than someone dealing primaril) with congested roadways.
 </p>
 <p>
  I would take this a step further by having a central clearinghouse that would collect and analyze data that would be shared via an intranet with participating beat reporters to localize. An analysis of aviation safety records at large airports, for example, could generate dozens of local stories. But someone needs to be driving the process. This effort could start out small, with a core of newspapers piloting.
 </p>
 <p>
  By doing this, CAR proponents could do more than just evangelize and convert one reporter at a time. They could expedite a more sweeping embrace of CAR in newsrooms, and they could influence what gets covered and how. Many of us grumble about the unhealthy influence of coiporate ownership. I see this as a way of constructively steering the ship closer to its appropriate course.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think we collectively have enough experience to do some of the things I’ve suggested. Newsroom management has bought into the CAR concept, so that part of the challenge is behind us.

  The challenge we face as we move forward is incorporating CAR in a more systematic and intelligent way. As an industiy, we’re not as good as we could, or should, be and I think CAR is our best realistic hope for improvement. Those in the front lines need to devise ways of imbedding the practice throughout our newsrooms. We need to broaden our strategy for accomplishing that.
