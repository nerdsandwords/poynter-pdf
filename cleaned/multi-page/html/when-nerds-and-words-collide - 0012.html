  something to call the program. I also hired an on-the-road trainer, Jennifer LaFleur, who was working part-time in the newsroom and part- time in the marketing department at the
  <em>
   San Jose Mercury News.
  </em>
  LaFleur was a Missouri alum, had worked with Jaspin, had been my partner at a 1990 boot camp, and majored both in journalism and computer science. Meanwhile, Richard Mullins, a self-taught computer expert who had worked at newspapers and the National Library of Money and Politics, was hired in early 1994 by the school of journalism to teach the classes that Jaspin had taught and to work with NICAR.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joining us were Matt Reavy, a doctoral candidate at the school who had taught some of the seminars, and Drew Sullivan, a journalism graduate student with a background in engineering and computers. While rejuvenating the database library and newsletter, we began reshaping the syllabus for CAR. We also began collaborating with Phil Meyer at the University of North Carolina and James Brown at Indiana University, two main leaders in CAR in the academic world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Richard, Jennifer, and I realized that the syllabus for CAR in Missouri needed to be revamped and become more inclusive. Software had become easier to use, and different groups supporting one kind of software or another had popped up. (There actually were panels at an IRE conference that pitted spreadsheets against database managers, as though you could use only one kind of software.) More data were available on diskettes or online, and the online world was about to explode because of the World Wide Web.
 </p>
 <p>
  Five years of experience also demonstrated that CAR could effectively be used for daily and beat stories if a journalist was well-trained and prepared. We also knew that CAR training needed to have a kinder and friendlier reputation if we were going to spread the word.
 </p>
 <p>
  After reviewing all the different methods of training at CAR conferences and programs, we basically stood the syllabus on its head. We decided to first show stories produced by CAR, so journalists could see it was worth learning new skills. Then we had cleaned and prepared data sets so journalists could learn software without being distracted by too many records. Then we talked about how to find databases, negotiate for them, and download or import them. And we showed them how to build a database if it didn’t exist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, we realized we needed two versions of the syllabus - one for weeklong seminars, and one for shorter, on-the-road Raining. The second NICAR on-the-road trainer, Neil Reisner, helped expand our focused Internet training and bring more attention to daily- and beat-reporting uses of CAR.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our third NICAR trainer, Sarah Cohen, brought a level of sophistication to practical uses of statistical methods that we had not had before.
 </p>
 <p>
  But no matter how we changed, each syllabus emphasized learning the three basic tools of CAR: online resources, spreadsheets, and database managers. Since then, we have developed a syllabus for database design and database cleaning, database administration, mapping, and, with Phil Meyer, statistical methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some journalists told us when we began that there would be little demand for training, and the market would be saturated
 </p>
 <p>
  quickly. They also said that newsrooms, both in print and broadcast, would not pay enough to keep the institute going. Instead, we have been conducting 40 to 50 seminars a year in Missouri and the rest of the United States since 1994, most frequently for $1,000 a day plus expenses. The overall syllabus and level of the seminars has increased in sophistication. With grants from the Freedom Forum and the Knight Foundation, we have increased our training for minority journalists, who recognized in 1994 that they were being left out of the technological loop.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a grant from the Joyce Foundation, we have gathered campaign finance databases and started a training program in that area. With a grant from the Robert M. McCormick Tribune Foundation, we have initiated a major training effort in Central and South America.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also have put together joint seminars with the University of North Carolina, the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, Columbia University, and the New York University, and we have held joint conferences with Jim Brown at Indiana University. Our seminars also have drawn journalists from Scandinavia, Central and South America, and other parts of Europe. We have been invited to conduct more training in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. (Danish journalists formed their own NICAR-like organization last year.)
 </p>
 <p>
  During the past five years, I have written two editions of my textbook,
  <em>
   Computer Assisted Reporting: A Practical Guide,
  </em>
  that gathered together what many of us had learned about training and provided at least one road map for classes in newsrooms and journalism schools.
 </p>
 <p>
  We estimate that more than 12,000journalists have been to our 300 conferences and seminars. Our database library does work for more than 130 news organizations a year. The number of students taking CAR at Missouri has grown from fewer than 10 to 30. The number of graduate students at NICAR has increased from two to 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet none of this means that the work is close to done.
 </p>
 <p>
  We know we need to provide training to editors and news directors so they can better understand and direct reporting that uses CAR and/or social science research techniques. We need to better tailor our training to the three tiers of journalists in a newsroom: end-users, who need quick answers based on searches of databases; power users, who want to do their own data analysis; and data crunchers, who not only do analysis but also download and clean more complicated databases.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the most important lesson we trainers have learned is to keep focusing on the critical thinking that the use of the software demands. And perhaps this is the revolutionary realization of CAR that creates trepidation and resistance.

  Journalists need more sophisticated skills to report in the 21st century. Stenography won’t do. Stories based only on shallow and ill-documented disputes and conflicts won’t do. Careless use of statistics and numbers won’t do. And refusal to provide training in these skills won’t do. Without the training, journalists will not be able to distinguish themselves from information brokers, Internet pamphleteers, or casual purveyors of idle, vicious gossip and rumor.
