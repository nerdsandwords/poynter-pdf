  Viva the Evolution!

  Pssst. The revolution is over. Here’s why.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first decade of reporting with computers was punctuated by anecdotal progress that was often painfully slow. Many newsrooms had one or two experienced journalists (most often a beat reporter, sometimes a news researcher or news librarian) who served as visionaries sensing that access to electronic public records would radically transform how journalists did their jobs. Most journalists were reluctant to associate themselves with a new way of accessing traditional information.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chutzpah of change had a high price tag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Computer hardware and software costs were measured in multiples of $
  10,000
  just to minimally equip a single work station. Blocks of time measured in multiples of months were needed to produce a story or series for the printed page. Convincing bean counters and line editors to commit these resources to a new way of doing things was a very hard sell, especially since the visionaries lacked newsroom rank and colleague support.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lone rangers began to realize the value of numbers in more ways than just counting records on a 9-track tape.
 </p>
 <p>
  Annual group therapy sessions for fledgling geeks began at Indiana University in Indianapolis and were later organized by the Investigative Reporters and Editors. The visionaries derived strength and direction from each other. IRE’s mandatory annual membership requirement made its association rolls soar with each new conference. “Computer assisted reporting” and “computer assisted reporting editor” were soon coined as the universal themes for the new electronic revolution in newsrooms. The lone rangers from the special project desks began organizing and learning how to function as a national collective - a CAR team.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of this was accomplished without organized hands-on training. Visionaries were self-starters and, for the most part, read manuals to learn how to access and analyze electronic data. Life looked good for a short while.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, at the peak of the CAR revolution, there was a revolt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beat reporters and increasing numbers of news researchers wanted in on the star status of CAR. They wanted access to technology and the prestige associated with spending months reporting a single story or project.
 </p>
 <p>
  The price of change was increasing. Bean counters and line editors began to balk. Where was the money for technology going to come from? And if many people in news were researching and writing CAR stories, who would be left to put out the daily paper?
 </p>
 <p>
  Almost overnight, a shift occurred. IRE’s members once again realized the power of numbers, and team journalism broadened its scope to include the beat reporting troops. The conference in Raleigh, N.C., was a turning point. It emphasized hands-on training labs. Once beat reporters got a taste of the power of electronic records, there was no looking back. How to move forward became the big question.
 </p>
 <p>
  How do you get more technology in the newsroom? How do you keep people current in rapidly changing technology? How do you keep from being run over and buried by the information explosion? How do you get CAR in the paper on a regular basis - maybe even every day?
 </p>
 <p>
  The answer was training. Specifically, hands-on training in local newsrooms.
 </p>
 <p>
  For training to work it had to be more frequent than a once-a-year infusion at a national IRE conference, especially since news budgets were not large enough to send every beat reporter who wanted to learn. The job description of CAR editors began to include teaching as well as data acquisition, storage and archiving, analysis, reporting, writing, and editing. People were overwhelmed. A new focus to organize the revolution was needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The training theme began as a post-conference “what should we do next year” discussion in 1990 when faculty members at Indiana University and a few journalists sat in the bar and tossed around ways to incorporate hands-on sessions. The cost and logistics of setting up just one training lab proved to be a large hurdle.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1993, the IRE conference in Raleigh emphasized multiple hands-on training labs and served as a model for what newsrooms should do back on their home turf.
  <em>
   The News & Observer
  </em>
  was really the first paper to set up an organized in-house technology training program.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the San Jose conference in 1994, the hands-on training issue was picking up steam. The conference continued to have multiple hands-on training rooms and a handful of newspapers had already begun experimenting with in-house technical training programs or “universities.” In these early times, reporters, researchers, or systems editors were wearing training hats in addition to their regular job duties. It was after this conference that the
  <em>
   St. Petersburg Times
  </em>
  agreed to create a new position for me - they made me a full-time technology trainer for the news department.
 </p>
 <p>
  The IRE national computer conferences continued to emphasize hands-on training labs, and interest in ways to organize local technical training was starting to gain momentum. Getting IRE to address how news organizations could create their own local training programs was a bit of a straggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  At Cleveland’s 1995 conference the issue was addressed in a last-minute roundtable addition to the formal schedule (cochaired by myself and Diane Weeks from
  <em>
   The Washington Post).
