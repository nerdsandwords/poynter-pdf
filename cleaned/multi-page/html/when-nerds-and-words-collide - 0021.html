  Using People, Not Numbers, to Tell the Story
 </h3>

  In inviting speakers to an annual conference on computer assisted reporting last year, I began to hear a new complaint: “That wasn’t computer assisted reporting,” at least a couple of reporters said. “There weren’t any numbers in it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That objection - a false one, in my view - is a telling detail in the state of computer assisted reporting in the United States. And it’s one that shapes much of my view of where the specialty is and what we might do to further its development.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe my concern over misconceptions that frame computer assisted reporting as reporting on numbers comes from my unusual background.
 </p>
 <p>
  As an economist for a decade before becoming a reporter, I felt that trade focused too much on figures and not enough on people and their problems. Economists, it seemed, had forgotten that the field is much more a human story than a quantitative one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon before I made my career change, a colleague armed with a doctorate in the field solidified the decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  He was considering the purchase of a townhouse in a pricey Washington suburb. He complained that a house he preferred down the street was exactly the same, but the sellers were asking “more than the market price.” This economist went on to describe the reasons he preferred the too-expensive one. They ranged from the color of the carpets to the sunshine that poured into the kitchen on cold winter mornings.
 </p>
 <p>
  I couldn’t get him to understand that the “market price” he sought was just a series of decisions by buyers like him on the value of the color of the caipets and a southern exposure in the kitchen. This, mind you, was someone who’d spent seven years in college studying microeconomics - the field that focuses on how prices are set.
 </p>
 <p>
  So came the decision to move to journalism, where reporters and their editors understood that human decisions describe what happens in the national and international economy better than numbers do. And, yes, I was lucky enough to later cover economics and frame the beat in my own words - making and spending money.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I was ill-prepared for the surprise I was about to encounter. It never dawned on me that journalists had managed to ignore the tools that had become a mainstay in virtually every other line of work, from economics to cash register design. The information revolution caused partly by the micro-computer and its applications had passed by the very craft that makes its living harnessing information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Computer assisted reporting was clearly in my future.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the past two years, though, I’ve been traveling the country helping others learn to use spreadsheets, databases, and other “computer assisted” tools in the newsroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s probably been more progress during these two years than any other. And it has nothing to do with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the Internet makes its way onto reporters’ desktops, as personal computers find their way into newsrooms, and as
 </p>
 <p>
  reporters watch how harnessing public records electronically can lead them to great stories, there are terrific examples of successful daily and project work around the country. A few worth noting:

  was instrumental in a too-rare partnership among editors and beat reporters to document voter fraud. There were few numbers in the ensuing project. Instead, the newspaper documented cases of voter fraud that helped overturn an election and prompted legislative change.
 </p>
 <p>
  I highlight these stories because they’re the kinds of stories that
  <em>
   should
  </em>
  be more common. Working together to find newsworthy cases, using resources already acquired, and harnessing your desktop for one-minute sorting jobs are the key to using public records electronically.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think these are rare for a number of reasons.
 </p>

  The false choice
 </h4>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, many managers and reporters alike have set up a false choice in the newsroom - one that’s illustrated by the speakers’ objection that a story isn’t worthy of a computer assisted reporting panel if it doesn’t include numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The choice is between statistics and people in stories, or between social scientists and master storytellers in the newsroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, the promise of computer assisted reporting has never changed. It remains one of the best ways available to check tips, generate news sources, and help ensure that the moving human stories we tell reflect a larger truth.
 </p>

  The big-bang theory
 </h4>
 <p>
  Reporters and their editors are, by nature, impatient. Otherwise a newscast would never hit the airwaves or a newspaper would never hit the sidewalk. But this impatience gets in the way of reporters learning new skills.
