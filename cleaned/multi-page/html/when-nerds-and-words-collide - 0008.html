   Help the J-schools:
  </strong>
  Integrating CAR skills into traditional journalism training has been a challenge. Should journalism educators have elements of it in all classes, or give one class and hope the students apply those skills in other reporting/writing courses? Journalism educators have tried various approaches. What is working? What suggestions might there be for educators?
 </p>
 <p>
  IDEA: Develop some sample syllabi for journalism courses that incorporate CAR skills within the journalism curriculum. Also, canvass the journalism schools and find out their current CAR curriculum approaches as a way to provide some ideas and contacts to others.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Elevate numeracy:
  </strong>
  Numbers and understanding what they mean are the crux of CAR work. Too many journalists are math-phobic and uncertain in their interpretation of the significance of numerical data or how to do certain types of calculations. We need to help improve their competence and confidence in this critical area of journalistic work.
 </p>
 <p>
  IDEA: Create a math/spreadsheet competency self-test (along with a pre-test tutorial and clear explanation sheet for how to work the problems for self-evaluation).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Skills assessment:
  </strong>
  Just what comprises the suite of CAR skills? What techniques are involved? What processes are required for different techniques? How can journalists’ skill levels be evaluated, and how can they set their own learning goals? We need a skills assessment inventory.
 </p>
 <p>
  IDEA: Develop a list of CAR competencies that naturally build on each other and develop tests that can help determine skill levels reached after appropriate training.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Who’s doing what we should be doing and how did they do it?
  </strong>
  Various models and approaches have been taken for the use of CAR in newsrooms, from the “geek in the comer” to the “arm everyone who can shoot.” What approaches have been effective in newsrooms wanting to move CAR use forward, and why have they been effective?
 </p>
 <p>
  IDEA: Analyze the CAR operations in a variety of newsrooms to discover approaches taken, attitudes and perceptions held, and support given. These case studies can be used to help other newsrooms develop approaches to improving the access to and use of CAR techniques in their reporting.

  About this book
 </h4>
 <p>
  This book of readings, a set of CAR autobiographies, is the work of the participants in the January conference. They were asked to write about their place in the evolution of CAR in their organizations and in their work as journalists. In this collection you will find their definitions of CAR, reminiscences of their discovery of CAR, recollections of favorite “How I got ’em” CAR stories, and hard-earned advice to beginners and seasoned journalists venturing into the use of these ways of reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  We start the essays with an appropriate chronicler of where CAR has been and where it is going - appropriate because, in many ways, CAR started with him. Phil Meyer, author of
  <em>
   Precision Journalism
  </em>
  and champion of the use of social science research techniques in reporting, begins the set of readings with a typically provocative essay, “The Future of CAR: Declare Victory and Get Out!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Next come essays by the people most involved in three of the foundations of CAR training and discussion: Brant Houston on NIC AR, Jim Brown on NIAR, and Elliot Parker on CARR-L.
 </p>
 <p>
  These are followed by personal histories by CAR pioneers and current practitioners who attended the conference. Essays from our three international participants, representing the CAR perspectives in Mexico, Denmark, and the Netherlands are next. Wrapping up are a trio of essays focusing on the CAR education and training needs of the past, present, and future.
 </p>
 <p>
  We hope these essays will give you a sense of where CAR has been, how it got to where it is, and what it needs to keep it going. We’d like you to join us in this effort to better understand and promote the techniques of computer assisted reporting into daily and project journalism. Join the CARR-L or NICAR-L list-servs to be part of the discussion. Attend NICAR and IRE conferences. We will be presenting the ideas and issues that came out of this conference in a variety of ways and asking for your input.

  In 1991 Larry Sanders, then CAR editor at
  <em>
   USA Today,
  </em>
  said, “It won’t be long before some government agencies will not be keeping paper data anymore. If newspapers are going to maintain their ‘watchdog-of-the-govemment’ role, they are going to eventually have to have access to electronic data as well as paper data.” That day has come.

  An popular axiom about CAR is that it makes a good reporter better but it won’t make a bad reporter good. It’s not a magic bullet; it’s hard work. But it is work that can find and tell stories that you couldn’t find and tell otherwise.
