  staff with good computers should be ashamed. When every photographer carries around $50,000 to $60,000 in camera gear, it’s not too much to ask administrators to spend a few thousand dollars on each reporter’s computer.

  You have to do a lot of training to use a computer, and I’m too old to learn new tricks. I compare the fear of learning how to use computers to the fear of learning a foreign language. Fear keeps you from doing it. If you go to a foreign country for a couple of weeks, pretty quickly you’ll pick up enough of the language to communicate. Likewise, I highly recommend that reporters go to NICAR’s total immersion computer boot camp. You won’t know everything about computers after going, but you will develop the confidence you need to begin working on stories. It’s important to know that you don’t need to have some advanced data analysis degree to research a story. If you learn a few basic skills, you can start working on stories immediately. As you use those skills to turn stories, you’ll find yourself picking up many new skills.

  I can hire a computer expert to do the analysis for me. There’s no reason for me to learn how to do this. How often have you actually ended up with the same story you started out with? I start with a general idea for a story, but as I do my research, I often find that it changes and I end up with something quite different. If you give the work to someone else, he’ll do exactly what you asked him to do, but he won’t look at the information with a reporter’s eye. As a result, you might miss out on finding the story.

  For example, I once did a story on certified medics with crimes on their records. One day, as I was studying the EMT database, I stumbled across a medic who listed a prison as his address. When I researched it, I found that this guy was in prison because of sexual assaults on two boys. Upon arriving at prison, he filled out a change of address form and sent it to the division of EMS. They dutifully changed his address but didn’t revoke his license. They assumed he worked at the prison and never considered the fact that he might be an inmate. I most likely would have missed finding him if someone else had been doing my data analysis.

  The Internet is untrustworthy. It’s not a good place for a reporter to find information for a story. Although I have mainly been discussing using the computer for data analysis, the Internet is another powerful tool used by computer assisted reporters. Unfortunately, at almost every conference I attend, I hear someone say he wouldn’t trust the Internet as a source for information. The Internet is like any other source a reporter uses. The reporter should make sure he knows where the information is coming from and should never part with his protective cynicism. That being said, I would sure hate to handicap myself by throwing away the Internet. In so doing, I would also be throwing away thousands of official government websites (such as the Ohio site that puts every state law at your fingertips) and millions of print stories done by hundreds of papers across the country. The Internet contains fact and fiction, just as books do; it’s our job as reporters to determine which is which.

  It is with trepidation that I cite reasons why journalists should learn about computer assisted reporting. Citing reasons implies there is a choice. I don’t think there
  <em>

  a choice. Television
 </p>
 <p>
  journalists who refuse to start picking up the skills of computer assisted reporting will one day find themselves left far behind, and not just by other reporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our industry is changing before our eyes. For a moment. I’m going to step away from computer research and talk about the distribution of our product. Most reporters (and managers) in the television industry have given little thought to how our product is distributed. They take for granted that broadcast television will be around forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before your eyes glaze over with this topic, ask yourself what you would be doing if local television suddenly ceased to exist. While that may not happen completely, television will almost certainly change dramatically in the next few years, and it may not change the way we want it to. After the November 1998 ratings period, the number one question at stations across the country wasn’t, “Who’s number one?” It was, “Where are our viewers going?” They’re leaving broadcast television, which means advertising budgets likely will begin to dwindle. If that happens, you can bet news budgets will be cut.
 </p>
 <p>
  We know why our viewers are leaving us. They’re going to cable and to the Internet. But we haven’t decided how we’re going to adjust our skills and product so we can continue to exist in this new media environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  That brings us back to computer assisted reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using this skill allows us to generate unique and hard-hitting content for daily stories as well as for in-depth projects. If there’s a bad rap on television, it’s that we’re shallow. We’re great at live shots and fast-paced stories, but we’re often murky on the details. When news consumers of the future are deciding where to go to for credible information, carrying the label “shallow” will kill us. What we need more than anything else is great content that consumers will trust. Computer assisted reporting will help us develop that content and credibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  For daily stories, we can survey the resources of the Internet and the millions of print stories that exist there to help find context for our stories. We can also use in-house databases to make us better and quicker at doing our jobs. For instance, a state payroll database might lead us to an employee involved in a scandal on the day the scandal breaks - when people in his office won’t even talk to us. For big stories, data analysis projects give us depth normally unseen on television. Finally, the more stories we do based on research of databases, the more interactive information we can offer to our viewers on the Internet, which will help us build credibility in a medium other than television.

  So how do we get there? I believe news organizations need to make commitments to begin training eveiy content-producing employee in basic computer assisted reporting. That only sounds scary because we think of computer assisted reporters as specialists with a great deal of computer knowledge. We need to get past that attitude and start thinking about CAR as a tool all reporters should have on their tool belt. It’s a skill, like interviewing or researching or writing, that can help any good reporter become a better reporter. We shouldn’t all become specialists, but we should all understand the basics of using a computer to help research our stories.
