  About 20 people attended. For the Providence, R.I., conference in 1996, it took a flurry of e-mail messages among interested members to make it a part of the formal schedule. It certainly didn’t hurt that Stephen Miller of
  <em>
   The New York Times
  </em>
  joined the cause.
 </p>
 <p>
  By 1997 in Nashville, hundreds of people attended the panel session co-led by Miller, Weeks, and myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Newsroom technology training had come of age when it was recognized as the local and national answer for moving forward. The CAR revolution had ended, and the evolution was under way.
 </p>
 <p>
  At one panel hosted by Miller and in the halls of the Indianapolis conference in 1998, many members were asking the question - where are we headed now?
 </p>
 <h4 id="bookmark0">
  The next 10 years
 </h4>
 <li>
  The majority of newsrooms will establish regular and continuing in-house technology training programs to augment national and regional conferences.
 </li>
 <li>
  National and regional conferences will shift their focus to covering trends and “How I Wrote the Story” issues rather than trying to organize topic-specific hands-on training for the masses.
 </li>
 <li>
  Outsourcing news technology training to the human resources department or local training firms or local colleges and universities will dramatically decrease.
 </li>
 <li>
  Technology training will be done increasingly by a separate FTE position within the news department. This is a new career path in the journalism industry.
 </li>
 <li>
  Technology training programs will be enhanced by regular visits from professional journalists turned consultants who specialize in topics such as: training the trainers, creating contin
 </li>
 <p>
  uing training programs, mining all the gold from electronic data, special technical applications in spreadsheets, relational databases, and web-based (intranet) look-up applications. Consultants will serve to infuse local programs with customized detail.
 </p>
 <li>
  “Computer assisted paragraphs” on a daily basis for nearly every beat will become the norm.
 </li>
 <li>
  Producing the news report will become more of a cooperative effort among journalists worldwide.
 </li>
 <li>
  By 2009, it will be commonplace to see traditional print and broadcast media combining budgetary resources and newsroom talents to create the “new” journalism media, which will be electronic.
 </li>
 <h4 id="bookmark1">
  And after that?
 </h4>
 <li>
  News organizations will have increasingly global staffs.
 </li>
 <li>
  Worldwide, colleges and universities will incorporate practical skills-based journalism into each course using state-of-the-art technology financed by industry and corporations. Hands-on technology training will be completed before entering the professional job market for the next generations of journalists.
 </li>
 <li>
  Internships will be worldwide in focus rather than national.
 </li>
 <li>
  Colleges and universities will hire professional journalists, experienced in the global arena, as consultants on a regular basis to infuse their local technology training programs.
 </li>
 <li>
  In-house newsroom programs will shift toward maintenance of data warehouses that will be shared among news organizations in geographically regional and globally topical cooperative agreements.
 </li>
 <li>
  The era of worldwide electronic journalism will be in full swing by 2019.
