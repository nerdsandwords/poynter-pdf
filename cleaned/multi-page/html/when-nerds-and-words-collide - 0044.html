  overnight, but the direction of things is obvious. Computer data in its almost raw form is becoming the stuff of journalism. It was never practical to print, in a broadsheet, the whole Pentagon budget.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it is rapidly becoming practical to publish it on the Internet in a value-added form that would have utility for news consumers. I’d like to see journalists, not bureaucrats, do this and decide when it’s worth doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trouble is, we lack definitions for how this is done well. Some early efforts have stumbled. Meanwhile, few news organizations hesitated to publish the entire Kenneth Starr investigation on their Internet sites.

 <p>
  Where do we draw the line between source material for the journalist and material that is, in its entirety, worth passing along?
 </p>
 <li>
  Accept statistics. Computers, by their nature, invite the journalist to assess the bigger picture - the incidence, the prevalence, the significance, or the bias of things taken together.

  Journalists are notoriously poor at math. If they even endured a mathematics course in college, they likely avoided any
 </p>
 <p>
  exposure to the science of statistics. This is ironic because statistics empower the scientist to be objective in measuring complicated, subtle phenomena. We ought to be better social scientists and force ourselves to learn statistics or hire journalists who already know the subject. Try to do a story about redlining without statistical analysis.
 </p>
 <li>
  Establish ethical guidelines. We are in danger of losing our claim to digital information if we abuse it. The public and the courts are suspicious of journalists armed with computers. We need a more mature ethical code for handling computer data and respecting personal privacy in its use. We ought to rate commercial services and boycott them when they violate our profession’s code. We ought to distance ourselves from private investigators and mass marketers.

  We need this to maintain our only real asset, trust.

  I’m hopeful about the future for computer assisted reporting, whatever we decide to call it, and I’m very envious of my nephew’s future on the web.

  I’m also not about to get rid of my magnetic tape drive - yet -clickity-clack as it is.
