  (PI) began its activities in 1996, as a project of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) that was made possible by a grant from the Robert M. McCormick Tribune Foundation. The idea, presented by IRE members from Mexico and the United States, was to establish a training program in Mexico similar to the one IRE has developed in the United States and elsewhere for more than 20 years. The program would include workshops on computer assisted reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  In September of that year, Lise Olsen and I opened the new office in the country’s capital. Lise came with many years of experience in investigative journalism for various media in the United States, and with a history of activism as an IRE member and a teacher. I began my work in radio and television, and then went on to cover special assignments for seven years at the Mexico City daily

  The timing couldn’t have been better. In the last decade, Mexico has undergone immense changes, and the country is still going through a yet-uncertain political transition. The economic reforms undertaken by the last three administrations have been accompanied by constant electoral dispute, the rise of left- and right-leaning opposition that threatens the dominance of the governing Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), political assassinations, and the appearance of peasant guerrilla movements in the southern part of the country. This process has been closely followed by an increasingly conscious and participatory society that, above all, is much more ready to demand accountability from politicians.
 </p>
 <p>
  The media’s situation is also very different from that of a few years ago. Mexico has always had a large number of dailies - in the capital alone there are more than
  20
  - but quality journalism has always faced an uphill battle against the twin devils of payoffs and censorship. The same government that could be more than generous to friendly media could also become a mortal enemy to a newspaper that ran “uncomfortable” stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the government continues to exercise inappropriate influence on the media, many of the latter are progressively more dependent on public preference and advertisers than on official subsidies. Government censorship, meanwhile, has been reduced to a level that surprises the most skeptical of Mexicans.
 </p>
 <p>
  All this is beneficial to investigative journalism, which although not new in Mexico, has not developed to the level required by an increasingly sophisticated and demanding public. This is especially true for CAR, which very few Mexican reporters use.
 </p>
 <p>
  When we first offered our workshops on investigative journalism and CAR, the response was quite good and we encountered our first surprise: In spite of the marked centralism that besets Mexico, the interest in our project was much greater in cities other than the capital. Moreover, we also started to field queries and requests for workshops from media in other countries in the

  Both interest and skepticism
 </h4>
 <p>
  Our initial CAR workshops in newsrooms in Mexico and other Latin American countries generally provoked a curious mixture of skepticism and interest. Although our colleagues recognized the importance of investigative journalism and many practiced it with impressive results, relatively few had used CAR tools such as the Internet, spreadsheets, and database managers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, when we showed examples of computer assisted stories done in the United States, our new friends reacted with a sort of computer envy. They thought the stories were excellent reporting, but they also brought up all sorts of reasons to explain why this type of journalism couldn’t be done in Latin America. Some thought electronic information was not available or that official statistics were not reliable in our countries, while others argued that few reporters have modem computers and access to the Internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  What all agreed upon - and it is indeed a major problem - is that in the traditional political culture that persists in Latin American countries, bureaucrats and politicians tend to consider public information as a personal resource and assume the right to share it or not with the press and the public.
 </p>
 <p>
  This problem is particularly serious in countries such as Mexico, where freedom of information legislation is ambiguous and toothless, and in countries with a recent authoritarian past in which journalistic investigation is still stifled by “national security” constraints.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past few years, however, we have confirmed that CAR is not only possible in Latin America but that its use contributes to weakening the official monopoly on information. For example, reporters can use the Internet to find information through alternative sources that bureaucrats and politicians try to hide. Then they can analyze this information using spreadsheets or database managers, and compare it with official news releases. Once the reporting is published, those politicians are forced to respond, and on occasion this results in the release of information that was previously controlled. This is not an automatic, or even a frequent, process, but it does happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Latin American reporters also are finding that some types of official information actually are available, including socio-demo-
