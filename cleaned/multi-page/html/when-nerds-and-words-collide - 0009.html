  The Future of CAR: Declare Victory and Get Out!
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   By Philip Meyer

 </p>
 <p>
  The time has come to abandon “computer assisted reporting” - CAR. It’s an obsolete concept that is starting to get in the way of our understanding of the real battles that we need to fight and win if we are to save the soul of journalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  CAR is an embarrassing reminder that we are entering the 21st century as the only profession in which computer users feel the need to call attention to themselves. All of the other professions take computers for granted.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <p>
  My cousin Bob Meyer is a retired accountant, and he uses a computer to audit the books of his boat club, the Marco Island Sail and Power Squadron. He doesn’t call himself a computer assisted accountant.
 </p>
 <p>
  My daughter Melissa Meyer is an environmental designer in Coral Gables, Fla. She does her creative work on a computer. She doesn’t call herself a computer assisted designer.
 </p>
 <p>
  My cousins Max and Richard Benne are farmers in St. Joseph County, Mich. They use computers to calculate depreciation on their equipment and to calibrate the fertilizer applications for their corn and soybean fields. They don’t call themselves computer assisted farmers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s forget about the computer and start talking about, and organizing around, what we really want to do. Here’s what I think that is:
 </p>
 <p>
  Journalism today is in a battle for survival against the forces that would merge it with entertainment, advertising, and public relations. The information age has created such a confusing buzz of voices that it tempts us all to sacrifice almost anything for attention - including truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  What the practitioners of CAR have been after - whether consciously or not - is a higher standard of truthtelling. Our response to the information age has been to learn to manage larger bodies of information with increasingly powerful analytic tools, leading to a more exact definition of truth. As it happens, a computer is helpful in doing that. But the computer itself is not the goal, nor does it define what we are trying to do. We are trying to push journalism toward science. Almost everybody else, it seems on most days, is trying to push it toward ait.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pushing journalism toward art can justify or mask the merger of reporting and advocacy. It can facilitate the entertainment function of journalism - and we should never deny that entertainment is one of our functions. It can lead to a subjective form of truth in the postmodernist, phenomenological sense. But it will not, in the long run, lead to the building of credibility and trust that journalism needs if it is to survive as an independent information specialty.
 </p>
 <p>
  One response to information overload has been the elevation of spin. When attention-getting is more important than discovering and imparting the truth, the marketplace rewards those who are skilled at creating appearances. Our goal needs to be to find a way to help that marketplace reward the truth-tellers. The demand is a given. With so much effort devoted to crafty distor
 </p>
 <p>
  tion, the market value of truth has to rise as a function of its scarce supply. All a media company has to do is find a way to brand it and sell it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our little piece of this action should be the application of scientific method to the practice of journalism. We need to focus on the time-tested methods of overcoming wishful thinking, superstition, selective perception, and the other human frailties that hinder the acquisition of knowledge. We need to build a force in journalism that rewards critical thinking and the skeptical testing of conventional wisdom. Yes, the computer is a tool that can help us do that. But that’s all it is. Focus on the goal, and then we can take the computer for granted, as the farmers and accountants and designers already do.

  My first computer encounter was with the IBM 7090 at the Harvard Computation Center in 1966. Having failed miserably at two successive attempts to predict Ohio election outcomes for the
  <em>
   Akron Beacon Journal,
  </em>
  I was using my Nieman year to study social science research methods. I started with a course for sophomores in which each student was allotted two minutes of the 7090’s CPU time. My 120 seconds produced several cross tabs and significance tests from a survey of junior college students, using Harvard Data-Text, a higher-level programming language that was the harbinger of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
 </p>
 <p>
  For the second semester, I did advanced work in a graduate course after negotiating a deal with Dwight Sargent, curator of the Nieman Foundation. He gave me $100 to buy computer time in exchange for writing an article for
  <em>
   Nieman Reports.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  I was back on the job in the Knight Newspapers Washington bureau only a few weeks when the Detroit riot broke out, and I was dispatched to help the staff of the
  <em>
   Free Press.
  </em>
  The call came at noon, and that night I was riding with the National Guard amid the burning buildings and sniper fire of 12th Street. When the shooting ended and the fires were out, I proposed a survey of the riot neighborhoods to discover the riot’s underlying causes, applying the principles I had just learned at Harvard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course we used a computer to analyze the results. I recruited University of Michigan professors John Robinson and Nathan Caplan and computer programmer Judith Goldberg to help with the design and analysis. Goldberg did the crosstabs with Filter Tau, a program more primitive than Harvard’s but good enough. It ran on an IBM 360/40.

   Phil Meyer teaches two courses each semester while coordinating the master's program in journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He currently produces an occasional column of media criticism for
   <em>
    USA Today
   </em>
   and researches current trends in newspaper journalism.

  The response to that project inspired a long-term commitment by me and my management to this new form of journalism -
