  allowed me to log a lot of hours learning this stuff. In fact, I am only slightly ashamed to confess, I found the guru role intoxicating, as if I were starring in my own
  <em>
   Revenge of the Nerds.
  </em>
  Jaspin used to quote the adage, “In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.” I was enjoying my royal status, collaborating with the newspaper’s best reporters on its most important stories, pulling levers and pushing buttons whose function remained an utter mystery even to my bosses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, this phase didn’t last. After a year or two as a solo performer, I began to see that this guru thing was over-rated. In fact, it was becoming acutely painful. Each successful CAR story that went into the paper seemed to provoke several new proposals as reporters and editors began to recognize the potential of computer analysis. Having to tell my colleagues, “No, I don’t have time” put my stomach in knots. I certainly didn’t want to hold the entire newsroom back from this wonderful new resource.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly, it began to dawn on me that the success of CAR (and my own success) depended not on how cleverly I could crunch data for a particular story. More important was how effectively I could share these new resources with my colleagues. In fact, since I understood the value of computers to journalism better than perhaps anyone else in the newsroom, I felt I had a responsibility to lobby for change.

 <p>
  My lobbying fell on sympathetic ears, and in 1993 I got a new job title (the deadly “Manager of Information Technology”) and some help in the CAR guru department. Over the next couple of years we put PCs on more than 100 desks, all of them connected by this miraculous thing called a network. The network was strung haphazardly, with all of the cables converging to form a fire hazard in a corner of my crowded office. We sought guidance but received none from the newspaper’s moribund Information Systems Department. For networking software, we were using nothing but Windows for Workgroups, because it came free with the new PCs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Making use of the network, we built a Visual Basic application that allowed reporters to search driver’s licenses and vehicle registrations from their desks. We built another VB application that let them search and monitor all of the wire feeds. We taught reporters how to use spreadsheets and database software, and a few of them heartily embraced these tools (the remainder at least knew what the tools could do). The office network began to change the way CAR gurus worked with other journalists. (You still need experts even in a collaborative world.) Now the guru could handle the difficult task of obtaining the data and preparing it for analysis, but the other reporters could query the data directly, building their own analytical muscles in the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  As more reporters began to work in this way, analyzing data over the office network, it became clear that we needed a better way to manage the raw data. Using Microsoft Access to query a large database on a fileserver was painfully slow, since all of that data had to pass through the relatively narrow network pipes. So in 1995, we took the plunge into “client/server,” buying a beefy PC equipped with Microsoft SQL Server. This provided snappier performance by executing all of the actual queries on the

  beefy PC (the server), passing only the query statements and result sets back and forth over the wire.

  The highway and a rig called Lotus Notes

 <p>
  The network started to get a lot bigger in 1995, and so did the opportunities for an ambitious CAR program. Our newsroom got plugged directly onto the Internet, and the web was fast becoming a valuable research tool. The web browser began to make sense as a way to deploy internal databases, too. So using some Microsoft freebies, we migrated those old VB applications to our intranet, making it far easier for reporters to look up driver’s licenses, registrations, vital records, and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also in 1995, we started playing with an incredible product called Lotus Notes. I’d had my eye on Notes for several years, because from what I read in the trade magazines, it looked like an ideal platform on which to build a variety of newsroom tools, perhaps even an entire editorial system. For the next year or so, I oversaw the development of several Notes applications that formed the core production tools for the newspaper’s website. It was during this period that I began to see something that looked a lot like the big picture.

 <p>
  Big ideas began to percolate at the 1996 conference of Investigative Reporters and Editors in Providence, R.I. Night after night, beer after beer, it became obvious that lots of us CAR nerds were wrestling with the same challenges - how to use the tools of the Internet (web browsers and the network itself) to share knowledge within our newsrooms. What was the best way to put relational databases on an internal web page? What about other kinds of data?
 </p>
 <p>
  On my return from Providence, the big picture revealed itself in full: I saw the newsroom as a funnel through which huge amounts of a community’s information flowed every day like crude oil. Atypical newsroom was nothing but an antiquated, inefficient knowledge refinery. Reporters were technologically ill-equipped for this flood of raw information, in which ever-larger quantities were arriving in digital form. Clearly, outfitting those journalists with modern information-management tools had become an urgent, competitive necessity for the news industry. Clear to me, anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a series of impassioned memos and meetings, I tried to persuade my publisher that journalism faced a dire need, which in turn presented an opportunity to whoever might meet it. The need was for a two-pronged attack on information overload. Someone needed to develop software that made it easier to share relational databases (highly structured information about things and people) within a newsroom. And someone needed to make it easier for journalists to gather, organize, search, and share other kinds of information (more loosely structured things such as interview notes, e-mail, wire stories, and source documents).
 </p>
 <p>
  After three months it was apparent that the publisher wouldn’t be making up his mind anytime soon. But I was convinced that this was one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. I was lucky enough to be in a position from which I could see farther down the road than some of my colleagues. I was certain that one day in the not-so-distant future, all newsrooms would be
