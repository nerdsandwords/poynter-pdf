  Announcements range from job openings and a site for online hoaxes to Department of Justice reports on substance abuse and Asian corporate information.

  In typical Internet fashion, good statistics are difficult to obtain, but it is probably safe to say CARR-L has several thousand journalists and editors from at least 54 countries. Although Canada and the United States represent about 75 percent of the subscribers, others come from Iran, Singapore, and Australia. The number of journalists from Europe is increasing steadily. Several writers have used subscribers in other countries as sources for story backgrounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the major advantages of an e-mail list like CARR-L, compared with a World Wide Web interface, is the ability of anybody in the world with some kind of network connection to subscribe to the list. E-mail is the lowest common denominator on the Internet, requiring minimal network and computer resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  CARR-L seems to have matured. It has evolved from the enthusiastic first stages of a list, through the confusion of just what the list is “about,” to a certain stability.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has remained a place where journalists can get answers to questions and try out story ideas and techniques. A sense of community has evolved among the subscribers, along with a feeling of ownership of “my” list. Generally, when a topic or discussion strays too far afield, subscribers let the offender know. It remains heavily populated by working journalists and news librarians with an admixture of public relations practitioners. CARR-L remains a support group for those who are not in locations with physical connections with other journalists.

  Sitting on the academic side, and using the computer resources of an academic institution to support CARR-L, it remains surprising that, with the installed electronic, networking, and academic infrastructure, schools and departments of journalism have been so slow and reluctant to move into new technology. Even within the academy, where journalism might be expected to embrace new technology as a means of communication, other disciplines are leading the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Computer assisted reporting education at the university level has a spotty and variable history.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the 1980s, following the lead of most newspapers, most departments and schools of journalism were reluctant to commit resources to this new method of communication. Many remembered the experiments of the previous decade, such as Viewtron, and decided to “wait it out and see what happens.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As it became more obvious the world was undergoing not a computer revolution (that had already happened), but a communication revolution, some universities began to develop courses, not just for data analysis, but for online acquisition and analysis of information. Computer assisted reporting remains, however, very unevenly distributed across the academic landscape for a variety of reasons.
 </p>
 <p>
  In general, there is a considerable sense of inertia. Senior faculty, who tend to have the leadership role, see little reason to change, and those who do perceive some advantage run up against lack of support from other faculty and administrators. Many just do not have the time to learn a continually changing subject, even though many do have at least one statistics course in their background. And, of course, many suffer from number-and computer-phobia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Junior faculty, who might be expected to bring in new ideas, are unwilling to devote time or effort to a project or subject that will not count toward tenure or promotion decisions. Tom Johnson characterized this as the “fraud of journalism education” (“The Unconscious Fraud of Journalism Education,”
  <em>
   Quill,
  </em>
  June 1992).
 </p>
 <p>
  There is also a feeling that students just entering the journalism education pipeline will come with a knowledge of “computers.” Unfortunately, computer games and good hand-eye coordination are not much of a basis for computer assisted reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ideally, CAR would be integrated into all classes in a journalism curriculum so CAR becomes just another journalistic tool. In practice, the complexity of today’s computers means a few specific classes taught by interested faculty will integrate computer use. The majority of students will have a separate course, as more universities see the need for trained students, perhaps through the prism of CARR-L.

  Hopefully, even though the emphasis will remain on the needs of the practicing professional, CARR-L will remain a virtual newsroom where academics and working journalists can discuss how to use computers to “commit better journalism.”
