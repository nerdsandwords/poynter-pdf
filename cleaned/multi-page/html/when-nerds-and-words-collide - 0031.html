  Case study
 </h4>
 <p>
  Newsroom management set forth a vision for the
  <em>
   Mercury News
  </em>
  to be the “voice of Silicon Valley.” That meant that our internal technology literacy needed to be increased. The approach to research and computer assisted reporting tools has come from the newsroom with strong buy-in from the systems editor (a former reporter and editor). The goals early on were to:
 </p>
 <li>
  Get folks to use those boxes on their desks.
 </li>
 <li>
  Evangelize - get folks excited.
 </li>
 <li>
  Get as many tools as possible into their hands.
 </li>
 <li>
  Get stories into the paper.
 </li>
 <p>
  We began with a self-assessment of newsroom skill levels that showed a significant number of newsroom personnel had minimal or no Windows skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our goal was to expose as many people as possible to the tools available through “basic training.” The basics included: Computer Basics/Windows, Microsoft Mail, Introduction to the Internet, Introduction to Excel, and Introduction to Access. Within the first year, about two-thirds of the newsroom had taken at least one class. Once they were trained, it was important to keep their skills shaip, so I conducted a lot of one-on-one training and obtained databases for particular reporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Training at the
  <em>
   Mercury News
  </em>
  is not limited to reporters. All staff can benefit from these skills. Copy editors who are exposed to these tools tend to edit CAR stories better. The make-or-break group that needs training is assigning editors: If they support CAR, reporters will use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  A key move early in the process was to train top management. We offered a weekend “data retreat” where we talked about story ideas and managing CAR, and conducted hands-on training. Other related training includes math brown bag lunches and sessions by our lawyers on legal issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also learned how important follow-up is to developing CAR skills. Reporters can take classes forever, but until they actually get through the pitfalls of their first project, their skills really never become ingrained.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Mercury News’s
  </em>
  approach to computer assisted reporting is to give reporters the tools and the help they need to use as many of those tools themselves as they can. We don’t have an analysis department that feeds printouts to reporters because we believe analysis is part of the reporting process.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re now reaping the benefits of that approach, because CAR skills are more widespread. At any given time at least 10 people are working on some sort of story using CAR tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  Training, data, and stories all contribute to getting the word out. But repetition never hurts. We developed an irreverent monthly computer assisted reporting newsletter. The newsletter, along with tip sheets, the style guide, and other resources, is on the company intranet.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also offer frequent brown bag lunches with outside speakers discussing what their organizations are doing with CAR. This helps to get people excited.
 </p>
 <p>
  Money provides incentive. We give a quarterly cash award for computer assisted reporting. This helps CAR be recognized as an important reporting tool. (And not just because of the money. It also sends the message that if management is willing to give money for good CAR, it must be important.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Acquisition of data was more work on the local level than I had expected. We’ve faced difficult battles with the city of San Jose and other local and state jurisdictions for even the most basic data. We pursued a two-year fight for pet license data in San Jose, which we ended up losing in court. As a result, several news organizations in California have joined forces against some state agencies for data.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of our reference databases are on SQL server, accessible via a web browser from all desktops. This data initially was in Access with front-ends, but the system was just too overloaded. SQL server is faster and easier to use. Our reference databases include voter registration, business licenses, campaign finances, and corporations data.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next step was to work with bureaus and city/county reporters to acquire their own “resource” data. We’ve begun a strong effort in one of our larger, more CAR-savvy bureaus. We hope it will be a model for the rest of the newsroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point, most folks are able to use the Internet on their own, with help now and then on search techniques. Other tools such as databases and spreadsheets are being used regularly by a core of about 40 people. That number is slowly increasing. More advanced tools such as mapping and statistical programs are beginning to be used by our early adopters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The key has been to train assigning editors about CAR tools. The reporters who do the most CAR work report to editors who understand the tools. For example, our education editor demanded that all her reporters take classes and won’t hire anyone without basic CAR understanding. She now has several people who regularly use databases. One even uses statistical analyses frequently. (They call him “data boy.”)
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve tried to avoid the “magic wand syndrome” when folks want to do a complex project very quickly and promise way too much, too fast. As a solution to that, the new projects review process requires that folks check with the database editor before submitting their initial budgets. The database editor is also part of the projects review committee.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve had some great success stories. A good example is our road transportation reporter, “Mr. Roadshow.” When he first came to training, he’d ask: “OK, so do I turn the computer on now?” Several stories later, he has truly integrated CAR into his beat. When there’s an accident on a particular road, he now checks the accident database to find how often accidents have occurred at that spot. He’s also one of the most positive people in the newsroom and has served as a model for others.

  Where is computer assisted reporting today?
 </h4>
 <p>
  At the
  <em>
   Mercury News,
  </em>
  CAR is a valued tool for everyone. And although not everyone uses it, most folks think they should be. I’m not sure all newsrooms work that way. I think many newsrooms follow the old model of someone working magic in the corner and providing reporters with results. That does more harm than good. When the great and powerful Oz in the corner leaves for a better job, the newsroom is back to square one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ego is a big part of elitist CAR. Some CAR geeks still think most reporters are too stupid to really learn CAR. Good reporters can learn basic CAR skills and make use of them in their reporting. Some complicated tasks, such as data cleaning
