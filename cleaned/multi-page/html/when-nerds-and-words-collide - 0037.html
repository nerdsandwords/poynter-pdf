  More importantly, they are given lots of hands-on practice time. They analyze databases with the purpose of seeing how to ask the question and without the pressure of having to come up with a story. Our CAR fellowships have had mixed success. While some of our graduates have moved on to other papers or into editor positions (not veiy helpful to our CAR statistics), we have others who are doing then
 </p>
 <p>
  So what we’ve learned from our long and sordid history with CAR is that there is no one formula. No one approach works for everybody all the time. It doesn’t even work for us all the time. We’ve had to tailor our program to the personalities and skills and stories involved. And while those 27 stories produced by CAR graduates might sound like an insufficient return, it doesn’t take into account reporters who are using CAR in small ways on a daily basis, often because it has been introduced to them as one of many tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the early days of CAR, its proponents have insisted that it is “just another tool,” always comparing it to the telephone. Today’s journalist wouldn’t think of reporting without using the telephone and certainly doesn’t see fit to draw attention to its contribution to the story. What we’ve failed to do in making this analogy is to put it in perspective. Computer assisted reporting is hard and it’s time consuming. A big database analysis, like
 </p>
 <p>
  in-depth interviews and extensive travel, may not be appropriate for some stories, but thinking about databases always has a potential payoff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, even when the story is worth it, you’ll find journalists trying to get something for nothing. You will always have to contend with editors who want results with no investment of their reporters’ time, and reporters who want results with no investment of effort. The best CAR reporters are the same ones who are the best investigative reporters or the best sports reporters or the best police reporters.

  CAR also needs to become an everyday research tool. News research departments spend their money and energy on anticipating newsroom needs and building the resources to meet those needs. Perfect examples are our book collections and the newspaper archives. The expertise at work here can also be applied to identifying useful databases and making them accessible and searchable through intranets or local area networks.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the continuing issues for CAR in our newsroom are persistence and flexibility, both in training and in practice. The news research department has helped to provide the persistence to maintain our focus on CAR in light of the latest newsroom fads. We also provide a turf-neutral environment in which reporters get priority for their stories and a commitment to training. What we cannot provide, in the political reality of newsrooms, is the influence to push for the growth of computer assisted reporting. We are developing a bigger role in recognizing CAR opportunities and pointing them out to the newsroom, but we can’t “make them drink.” But neither can editors. A CAR program cannot exist without commitment from the top, but it cannot thrive without the drive of the reporters.
