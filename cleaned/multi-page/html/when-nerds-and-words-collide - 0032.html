  and statistical analysis, may not become mainstream for a long time, but basic spreadsheet and database work can be used by the entire newsroom.

  Some reporters think they are “above” some CAR skills. To some, CAR is not seen as reporting, but rather as a clerical function that doesn’t deserve the credit awarded to traditional reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The definition of CAR itself is now somewhat confusing. Frequently, students visiting the
  <em>
   Mercury News
  </em>
  say they do computer assisted reporting. When I ask more about what they do, they usually say they make web pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  The term computer assisted reporting is confusing in the age of the Internet. Is it data analysis? Is it publishing electronic information? Is it searching the Internet?
 </p>
 <p>
  I usually define computer assisted reporting as analyzing data to do stories that reporters couldn’t do any other way.
 </p>
 <p>
  In some cases, the news organization’s online arm makes better use of databases than the traditional newsroom. There is a disconnect between newsroom staff and online folks in an area where so much potential exists. In some cases, newsroom staff are interested in adding depth to their projects using online resources, but the online side shows little interest. In other cases, the online staff wants to develop in-depth online projects, but the newsroom is not interested in working with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s no question today that editors know CAR is important. I’m just not sure they always know why. Many newsroom managers still don’t understand enough to know how to evaluate whether someone has the skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some journalists face a lack of understanding by newsroom systems administrators, who put unreasonable restrictions on computer use. Folks in one newsroom were not allowed to use the floppy drives on their computers; others were not given Internet browsers because they might “play” on the Internet. These restrictions are ridiculous. Should we take away reporters’ telephones because they might call a friend, or remove their pencils because they might waste time doodling?
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall, we’re not at the level I would have expected 10 years ago. Although newsrooms have significant groups of CAR users, CAR is not widespread. Those who have been pioneers in this field should lead the way to integrate CAR tools to the extent that writing an essay about computer assisted reporting will seem as silly as writing an essay about telephone assisted reporting would seem today.

  More than 13 years ago, Jaspin said: “The power of this thing is unbelievable...Newspapers are either going to 81311 doing what we do, or they’re going to be bypassed and out-of-date.” We’re making progress, but we’re not quite there yet.
