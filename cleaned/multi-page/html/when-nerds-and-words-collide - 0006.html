  1989 was a watershed year for journalism. During the 1980s. the power of personal computers increased and the cost dropped. More and more government records were being shifted from paper to electronic fonnat. The message of Phil Meyer’s classic text.
  <em>
   Precision Journalism,
  </em>
  reached an audience of talented journalists who wanted to incorporate its promise of enterprise journalism and analysis into their reporting. These threads came together in 1989 with the establishment of two different organizations, organizations that would change many journalists’ perceptions from the computer as a word processor to the computer as a partner on their reporting team.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Indianapolis, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Andy Schneider joined the faculty of Indiana University School of Journalism and soon found a kindred spirit in Jim Brown. Together they conceived a way to begin spreading the word more broadly about the techniques of computer use in reporting. They named it the National Institute for Advanced Reporting (NIAR) and began making plans for the first conference to teach and discuss these techniques. (See Jim Brown's essay on page 8 for more details about the foundation of NIAR and the first conference.)
 </p>
 <p>
  At the University of Missouri, Elliot Jaspin created the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (MICAR), which held computer “boot camps” for journalists who wanted to be indoctrinated in the techniques of computer use in reporting. (See Brant Houston’s essay on page 6 for more details about the foundation of MICAR and its evolution to the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting, orNICAR.)
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the key developments that brought the potential of data analysis to reporters also was rolled out that year by Jaspin. With project partner Dan Woods, Jaspin created 9-Track Express, a way to use personal computers to manage the huge data files government agencies put onto 9-track tapes that previously had required mainframe computers to process.

  Through these training initiatives, grassroots industry buzz about CAR, and some high-profile, prize-winning stories that relied on computer analysis techniques, the dawn of the computer age in newsrooms seemed sunny and assured.
 </p>
 <p>
  But 10 years later, just what is the state of computer assisted reporting in newsrooms in the United States and around the world? According to a gathering at Poynter in January 1999. there is some good news and some bad news. Gains in the equipment (case of use, lowered cost, better software) have been weighed down by over-extended journalists who see using this suite of skills as a burden, rather than as a reporting opportunity. While it is true that CAR over the past 10 years has come to be seen as a way to do stories that couldn’t be done otherwise and helps fulfill the journalist's watchdog role, it is also true that these techniques can be hard work (from data acquisition to analysis), that they arc currently underutilized, and that many reporters still want to do things the “easy” way.

  conceptions, and to provide the information checks and balances in an increasingly data-based world? The Poynter Institute, NTAR, and N1CAR wanted to know.
 </p>
 <p>
  Together we decided to convene a group of 22 pioneers and practitioners of CAR techniques. They came to Poynter and, for two and a half days, discussed how CAR has changed the face of journalism and how it hasn’t. After establishing the continuum of CAR techniques - from use of e-mail, to searching online archives, to using the Internet, to use of spreadsheets, to developing databases, to social science research techniques - we all agreed that the battle line for CAR use was drawn at the level of spreadsheet use and above. E-mail, online archive use, and the Internet were, for a majority of journalists, a standard set of tools they used. It was these other tools of computer use in reporting that we wanted to assess.
 </p>
 <p>
  We asked the group to help us identify the issues that continue to challenge journalists interested in using these techniques in their reporting and newsgathering. We had them advise us on the kinds of research projects we should undertake that could help the industry understand the impact of CAR work on journalism. Wc challenged them to identify the tools, resources, or guidelines journalists still need that can help them use these techniques with more confidence and ease. Here are some of the highlights:

 <p>
  Issues
 </p>
 <p>
  The issue areas identified by the group fell into five broad categories with specific concerns under each:
 </p>
 <p>
  Skills/professionalization
 </p>
 <li>
  Deciding whether CAR/numeracy should be a job requirement for journalists and at what level.
 </li>
 <li>
  Establishing our identity as a profession.
 </li>
 <li>
  Putting CAR skills/numeracy on entry-level skills tests and regular performance reviews.
 </li>
 <li>
  Defining what wc do in terms of objectives instead of tools, clarifying the vision of CAR, and figuring out how to brand and sell it.
 </li>
 <li>
  Promoting social science principles into the daily practice of journalism.
 </li>
 <li>
  Creating a well-described set of skills for doing CAR and developing industry standards regarding technology skills and knowledge.
 </li>
 <li>
  Developing a full tool box of reporting skills that integrate CAR with other skills (social science, traditional reporting, civic
