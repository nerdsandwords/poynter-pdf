  sketchy information from here and there and using each bit to leverage more details and to pin down more names and dates.

  ■    I used different gaps in different computer data left by the sealing of court cases to reconstruct facts about sealed cases and zero in on abuses in the act of sealing.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    I compared data tapes of teachers against data tapes of criminals. Data tapes of cops against data tapes of gun dealers. Data tapes of wrecked cars against data tapes of used cars re-sold but not-so-well rebuilt.

  ■    I wheeled a PC and tape drive into the governor’s office, demanding to make a copy of the state payroll when officials had foot-dragged, to prove that the governor was really adding employees, not cutting them, as he’d claimed.
 </p>
 <p>
  My little stories made a difference. A union president was indicted. Judges were investigated. Laws were amended. Dangerous teachers were getting fired. Gun control was toughened. Car dealers were made more honest. A rural 911 system was created. The governor was forced to set the record straight on spending. I left my old job for a bigger one at The Associated Press.

  At the same time that computer assisted reporting was becoming mainstream, a parallel revolution in investigative journalism was happening - one that confuses many editors and publishers because it seems to be part of the same thing: online research. It was exploding in its usefulness and power. Meanwhile, its relative cost was plummeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  This sea change began among quieter newsmen and news-women, news librarians.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same digital automation that Elliot Jaspin had adapted to reviewing government records was being used to automate the newsroom morgue, cutting hours off a mindless chore every reporter and editor faced daily: looking up what was published last week or last year. As more publications did it, an economy grew out of everyone using everyone else’s electronic morgue. The tools for this kind of research, the personal computer and a modem to connect to other computers, opened up an infinity of sources for the journalist.
 </p>
 <p>
  It made sense for these tools to evolve in the news library. Librarians are educated to appreciate the issues of electronic research. They’re quicker to grasp its significance. Journalists are reluctant to admit a computer can out-report them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am continually amazed at how much I can learn quickly from online research and the exponential rate of innovation it is enjoying:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Litigation.
  </strong>
  In just the last year, it has become possible to do a search of all federal court cases by a litigant’s name.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Business records.
  </strong>
  Dun &amp; Bradstreet has taken its intelligence files on companies and loaded them into a relational database. The Securities and Exchange Commission is essentially all electronic now. Corporate records are easier than ever to search.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Finding people.
  </strong>
  The choices for locating and identifying people are ballooning. I use Phone Disk, a CD-ROM product that basically re-creates every phone book in America, searchable every which way - and my whole organization uses it routinely. Professional directories are going electronic, one by
 </p>
 <p>
  one. AutoTrack, CDB Infotek, and other detective databases are becoming frighteningly more comprehensive and cheap.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Government data.
  </strong>
  The revised federal Freedom of Information Act of last year is forcing agencies to design new computers with public access in mind. Much of what used to be a struggle to get is readily available online.
 </p>
 <p>
  I used to hear editors and publishers say: “Reporters don’t need a personal computer.” A reporter’s computer was a word processor - a typewriter with a TV screen. Now, I don’t know of a newsroom in America that isn’t scrambling to cram all manner of new gizmos into its next capital budget. Computer assisted reporting and online research aren’t experimental in journalism anymore. They’re essential. They’ve been adopted.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the biggest change in the decade since Elliot Jaspin began showing off his tape contraption is a monster: the Internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Forget about magnetic tapes and modems - at least, in the long run. When I watch my 4-year-old nephew click his way around the World Wide Web, I am both astounded and terrified at the future of journalism and mass communications. Clearly, in the future, everything in the information world will be a website. Anyone who’s anybody will have a website, and use websites, or be nobody and nowhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Internet is really just a set of rules - rules for any computer to talk through telephone lines to any other computer. But these rules work. They’ve caught on, and with an unstoppable momentum. They’ve reached critical mass.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Computer assisted reporting,” as the idea was first envisioned, barely begins to encompass what we, as journalists, will have to confront in the world of technology if we are to preserve the profession’s higher callings. Computers are becoming information appliances and are destined to be as ubiquitous as toasters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given where we are, and where we’ve come from, I think that reporters who have styled themselves as users of computer assisted reporting need to grapple with several issues:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ■    Get a name.
  </strong>
  We need a better name and a definition for this intersection of reporter and computer. Words matter. “Computer assisted reporting” doesn’t make sense as a name for what many of us do. The novelty implied by it will never last. As a former colleague, Bill Dedman, once noted in an article in the
  <em>
   Columbia Journalism Review,
  </em>
  it’s like talking about something called “telephone assisted reporting.” Of course, we use telephones and, of course, we use computers to report the news.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s too much of a “duh” name. How do we differentiate “CAR” from online research? I’d argue there’s no difference.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ■    Make new divisions of labor.
  </strong>
  I don’t see any way that a journalist, a writer and assessor of facts, could possibly stay on top of the changing world of technology and continue to do his or her job. Technology is just too complicated. The tradition for the journalist is to function as a lone wolf, getting all the facts and writing the story. However, just as an on-camera TV reporter has a producer and crew behind him or her, we need a workable role for technology experts to back up the reporter. What do we call them?
 </p>
 <p>
  We also need to resolve how one of the standard institutions of the news operation, the library, fits into a newer structure. It ought to be actively involved in the newsgathering process.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ■    Admit that data can be journalism.

  It won’t happen
