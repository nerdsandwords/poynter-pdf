  Stories Are the Proof
 </h3>

  Introducing CAR raises a lot of opportunities for journalists to concentrate on education, computer adminstration, meetings, conferences, writing books, and so on. But getting stories in the paper will be the best proof of the technique. The bottom line is that stories count, and somebody has to write them. So you’d better learn to be good at that.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the main lesson.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reporters in Denmark - the small country with 5.2 million inhabitants - are some years behind American journalists in their use of CAR.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the outset, there was a rather defeatist attitude toward CAR in Denmark. Common thinking was that if we did the same land of stories that were done in the United States, we would be put in jail. But in the last three years this has changed fundamentally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the authorities of other Scandinavian countries, the Danish authorities have made much use of computers, but access to electronic information has been very restrictive. There generally is no legal basis for gaining access to electronic information.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, the Danish population since 1970 has had some possibility of access to paper documents, and slowly a practice of fighting for this access has developed. Over the years, one professor at the Danish School of Journalism (DJH), Mr. Knud Aage Froebert, especially has helped journalists gain access.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although no right of access to electronic data exists, many authorities are prepared to pass on information anyway. Moreover, other laws can be used to formulate precise requests for an alteration of the existing rules.
 </p>
 <p>
  CAR requires persistence. My

  colleague Flemming Svith and I learned this from a course and a trip around the United States in 1996. In retrospect, the strategy of introducing CAR in Denmark has consisted of a number of elements:
 </p>
 <li>
  Using theoretical and legal reports that present the request to access electronic documents.
 </li>
 <li>
  Persuading individual authorities to experiment with different kinds of electronic access.
 </li>
 <li>
  Making the trade union, the publishers’ association, and DJH agree and compromise concerning the requests of the press; involving all parties in the work.
 </li>
 <li>
  Educating ourselves about CAR and developing our technique.
 </li>
 <li>
  Getting international CAR contacts.
 </li>
 <li>
  Writing good articles based on computer assisted reporting, proving in practice that CAR results in better journalism. (This is perhaps the most important element.).
 </li>
 <li>
  Establishing an association and network of contacts for journalists who wish to start working with CAR.
 </li>
 <li>
  Training journalists and establishing a CAR institute.
 </li>
 <p>
  All the elements have played an extremely important role in progress in Denmark. And we have been lucky. In the begin
 </p>
 <p>
  ning, only a few people were active. Now a very important mix of people are active. Reporters in different fields of expertise have been able to cooperate. And from the outset, a very experienced FOI lawyer has joined the effort and used his reputation to make the field important. Moreover, there has been support from DJH management, the trade union, and the publishers’ association.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, there have been lots of problems and difficult decisions. Sometimes we have made the wrong choices and evaluations, but help and debate have made us able to move in the right direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the most important decisions was made in April 1998. Before that, the Association of Computer Assisted Reporting in Denmark had been founded, the first Danish CAR day had been launched, authorities’ experiments were in progress, etc. The first courses had been run and the first articles had been written.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consequently, we decided to establish DICAR - the Danish Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting. Based on experiences from Sweden and the United States, we realized that a more formal and ambitious structure of CAR training and communication of experience was needed. The institute was based on three important principles:
 </p>
 <li>
  It would be non-profit.
 </li>
 <li>
  The association, i.e. the active journalists, would be in control.
 </li>
 <li>
  Quick action in the beginning in order to secure a stable and democratic system later on.
 </li>
 <p>
  And it has worked. We are putting the finishing touches to the statutes and a cooperation agreement with DJH. We have run the first courses, we have a home page on the Internet, we organize conferences, we are beginning to receive money, and we have so much work to do that the institute needs a part-time employee.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then comes the difficult part - to write good articles based on CAR in an environment that does not include the same kind of open access to data as in the United States. That gave us a lot of problems. The first articles were not very good. But they were there. Our aim was to learn to master the technique by means of small articles and small sets of data.
 </p>
 <p>
  The approach backfired. Many members of

  's editorial staff began to question the value of CAR. At one point we were forced to change our strategy. We had to delay and change the priority of the other tasks to make a serious effort to write good articles. Begining in the summer of 1997, participation in seminars, meetings with authorities, and the training of
