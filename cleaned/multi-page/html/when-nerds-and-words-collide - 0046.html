  graphic census data, health statistics, and electoral data. Such information is not only trustworthy; it holds a vast potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has also been interesting to note how many Latin American government offices, perhaps because their directors want to feel so very modem, have extensive websites. Ironically, much information can be quickly found at these sites that would take days or weeks to find in a traditional press office, given the poor organization or intentional procrastination of the bureaucrats involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last but not least, Latin American reporters also make more frequent use of information from the private sector, including financial and economic data. In this area it is common for information managers to be more willing to share documents that are often available in electronic form and ready for analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another advantage for Latin American CAR is that many governmental offices and private firms skipped the era of mainframe computers and work mostly with PCs. Therefore, Latin American reporters can usually obtain information in a more accessible format compared with their U.S. colleagues, who struggle with older and clumsier machines.

  Some examples, some results
 </h4>
 <p>
  Our CAR workshops are usually quite interactive, and many colleagues who take them immediately began to apply the techniques learned. For example, during a Microsoft Access workshop in Brazil, we used a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service database of legal immigrants to the United States; a few days later one of the reporters ran a front-page story on the “brain drain” of Brazilian executives to the United States, lured by attractive professional offers. It’s true that he was no newcomer to CAR, but we have seen many colleagues with no former training start working on story ideas or at least build a personal database even before the workshop is over.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some Latin American colleagues are doing very interesting things with their own databases, built from information from paper documents. For example, reporters from the daily
  <em>
   Publico,
  </em>
  in Guadalajara, Mexico, and
  <em>
   El Universal,
  </em>
  in Caracas, Venezuela, have done interesting articles on the profile and background of felons convicted for drug-related offenses. In both cases they got the information from judicial sources - in Venezuela it was relatively easy, while in Mexico it was like pulling teeth - to later design their database, enter the data, and analyze it using Access.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Publico
  </em>
  ’s series was particularly interesting. It showed that only 5 percent of the arrests had been the result of police investigations. The rest resulted after random inspections, tip-offs, or even accidents in which vehicles carrying drugs were involved. These stories also detected glaring inconsistencies in sentencing patterns. For example, a kid caught at home with two dope plants is serving the same jail time as a recurrent smuggler who was captured while transporting dozens of pounds of cocaine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Latin American reporters also are taking advantage of those fields in which access to information is improving, including official information in digital format. CAR has allowed Jose Roberto Toledo, of
  <em>
   Folha de Sao Paulo
  </em>
  in Brazil, to use statistical information produced by government offices to portray the darker sides of his society. Last year, for example, he used data
 </p>
 <p>
  from the Ministry of Health to inform readers that homicide is the first cause of death among children between
  10
  and 14 years of age in Sao Paulo, and that in many cases the killers are their own parents.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another fertile area is electoral coverage. In all the countries we have visited we have found a treasure trove of electoral data, compiled by the government or private organizations, which can often be accessed on the Internet. Mexico provides a dramatic example: In the controversial 1988 elections, the results from some polling stations had not arrived in Mexico City one week after the election. In 1994 the now-independent electoral authorities began to deliver the results in the afternoon of election day to several Internet sites, and by dawn Mexican and foreign reporters were analyzing, charting, and mapping the final (albeit unofficial) tally.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a rich vein of information about campaign finances and the relationship between elected officials and private interests that Latin American reporters have not yet fully explored, perhaps because related laws are new in many countries. Information is not as abundant as in the United States, but once again some papers such as
  <em>
   El Universal
  </em>
  offer in their websites extensive data in databases created by the paper’s staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Latin American reporters also are finding new ways to bypass the hurdles to information in their
 </p>
 <p>
  Gerardo Reyes, Internet enthusiast, friend, and
  <em>
   Miami Herald
  </em>
  reporter, provides a telling anecdote. He was teaching an Internet workshop to a group of Central American journalists, and while he was using the General Accounting Office’s site as an example, a Honduran editor literally jumped out of his chair. Reyes had run into extensive data on U.S. military aid to the Honduran military. The editor ran to the phone to convey this information to his colleagues. The information, he explained, is “classified for national security reasons” in his own country.
 </p>
 <p>
  The end of the Cold War has also played a role. In Mexico, Claudia Fernandez discovered that the U.S. government was declassifying a large number of documents from the KGB. One should recall that during the Cold War, Mexico City was an important espionage center, a sort of Latin America Vienna. Fernandez used the National Security Archives web page to obtain information sent to Moscow by the Soviet embassy in the 1940s and ’50s. She used this information to do a four-part series on Soviet espionage in Mexico, and she described the activities, code names, and even identities of Mexican spies, including artists, writers, and ordinary citizens.

  In the business and economic beat, Francisco Vidal navigates for hours each week to find ideas, tips, and hard data to support his reporting. For example, when researching the numerous mergers between large Mexican and multinational firms, he was stonewalled by most executives. On the Internet, however, he has been able to find much of the necessary information, either at the sites of the financial firms that deal with this type of transaction or, ironically, at the pages of some of the very firms that wouldn’t provide information through more traditional channels.
