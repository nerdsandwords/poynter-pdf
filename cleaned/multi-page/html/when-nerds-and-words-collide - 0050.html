  On the Road to Digital Journalism
 </h3>

  I remember very well the technology that was used the first time I entered a newsroom. Newspapers were still situated in the center of the city, and the editor in chief wrote the editorial with his fountain pen. It was by accident that I entered the newsroom of that local newspaper,
  <em>
   De Gelderlander,
  </em>
  in the city of Nijmegen. As a student, in need of money, I was employed on a temporary basis as a proofreader. The technology was of childish simplicity; as proofreader, I used a red pencil. It wasn’t much better in the newsroom. The ultimate technology was the message system of wind-mail, an ancient forerunner of e-mail based on ah
 </p>
 <p>
  When I now enter newsrooms, not only of the national newspapers but also the remotest regional and local newspapers, they are filled with high information technology: computers, networks, Internet and intranets, and the most advanced software.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing one can conclude from this development is that the demands on journalists have became much greater in recent years. Of course the old techniques and skills are still important and very useful. Every journalist must always possess some curiosity, know how to tell a story, and so on. But journalists now also need to know how to handle modem information technology. “Hard-nosed reporting, cultivation of sources, and public records searches may have once amounted to sufficient journalistic skills. But today, in the face of a rapidly growing Internet, journalists need training in new media” says Neda Raouf in “Cross-training Journalists,”

  Skills in these media range from simple word-processing, handling digital images, and editing on screen, to retrieving the latest unemployment figures from the Internet, and calculating key figures about unemployment in spreadsheets. These new demands on journalists are not only in searching for news. The digital revolution also has influenced publishing; the Internet is sometimes called the “fourth medium.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore journalists must also know how to handle text on the Internet: the basics of html are as important as copy markup language for letterpress printing. Writing has evolved from a linear process to a multi-dimensional one. And interactivity, two-way communication with readers, is an important characteristic.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth medium, however, is more than shovelware; it integrates sound and video. Newspaper journalists have no experience with these techniques, and TV journalists have little experience writing articles. “We learned a lot, but still we have a long way to go,” says Theo Stielstra, editor in chief of
  <em>

  “Our online edition is still close to the hardcopy edition, and the number of journalists who use sources on the Internet is limited; this will change in the coming months when the complete newsroom is online.”

  As an educator, my first question is: How do we prepare students for this new situation? They are the workers of tomorrow, so they must be trained in latest skills. They must know the state of the art in detail.
 </p>
 <p>
  My second question is: How do you train journalists so they can work with this new technology?
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally: In what context will journalists be working? What changes in communications could take place?
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1989 I was teaching several international classes about politics of European Union (EU) and European reporting. My search for the latest press releases of the European Commission brought me by coincidence to the Internet. One of the data networks I accessed to the press database of the EU offered a gateway to the Internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was very pleased to discover that I could send mail and files to persons at the other side of the pond. Of course, the CompuServe I used at the time was more user-friendly, but this Internet connection had new, unexpected possibilities. My Dutch colleagues were impressed when I told them how I got the latest information about the U.S. Social Security system. I left a message at the CARR-L discussion list, and within the hour received the address of the Gopher of the SSA.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, my colleagues were not seduced by the new technology. “Too difficult for day-to-day practice,” they said. After graphic Internet browsers were introduced in 1993, they changed their opinions. Now they are all on the grid and use it for lectures and training.

  Education of journalism students
 </h4>
 <p>
  The situation on the European continent differs from the Anglo-Saxon ways of journalism education. In the Netherlands, journalism is not taught at universities but in professional schools. In theory the difference is big. But from my experience, based on teaching in the United States, United Kingdom, and South Africa, I learned that in practice we are close, and agree quite often on standards for education and amount of practical training. The main difference is that in the Netherlands we also teach sciences, such as politics, social sciences, and economics. These are tailor-made for the profession and integrate writing and reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  CAR training starts in the students’ first year. During one term the students are trained in basic skills: e-mail, the web, search engines, html, spreadsheets, and databases. Sometimes assignments are very specific and isolated; more often assignments are
