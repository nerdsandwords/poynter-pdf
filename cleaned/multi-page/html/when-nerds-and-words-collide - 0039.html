  The most serious problem with moving forward is that management too often just doesn’t get it and can’t admit it. Most senior managers of news organizations grew up during an era when all a foreign correspondent needed was a notebook, a pencil, and enough money to bribe a telex operator. They’ve never had to use the technology in the field themselves, so it’s alien to them. And if you’re running a major news organization, can you admit that some snot-nosed kid fresh out of college knows more about the technology than you do? “Hey, kid, come here and teach me how to analyze the mayor’s budget using a spreadsheet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I once asked a group of journalism students at a major university how many knew what a telex was, and got no response. I asked that same group if any of them had an e-mail account. Every hand went up. At a conference of senior news managers, I asked the same questions. Everyone knew what a telex was, but only a third of the group had an e-mail account. I also asked those who did have an e-mail account how often they used it. Most used it sporadically, and one had never used it.

  Putting technology to work
 </h4>
 <p>
  1992 was the first year that
  <em>
   The New York Times
  </em>
  used PCs and Local Area Networking (LAN) technology to cover the political conventions. In addition to word processing and communications software for writing and filing, we had electronic access to all the wire services and all the major online databases: Lexis-Nexis, Datatimes, Dialog, and Dow Jones News and Retrieval. Because the system was relatively new, a series of classes were scheduled for anyone who wanted lessons in using all the new toys.
 </p>
 <p>
  No one showed up.
 </p>
 <p>
  A couple of days into one of the conventions, I noticed one of our top political reporters hovering over the fax machine. He was waiting for one of the clerks in Washington to fax him a copy of a wire story.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why are you doing that?” I asked. “You can read the wires on your PC and even filter it so that you only get the stories you’re interested in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I don’t have time for all that stuff. I just need to know how to write my stories and file them,” was the terse reply.
 </p>
 <p>
  “OK, let me get this straight. You’ve just made a costly longdistance phone call to D.C. to get a clerk to print out a wire story
 </p>
 <p>
  from his computer. He then has to take the pages across the room to the fax machine and make a second costly long-distance call to this fax machine so you can read a wire story that can be displayed on your computer screen four feet away? And the reason for wasting all that time, not to mention the company’s money, is because you’re too lazy to learn how to read the wires on your PC?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Several years later, I had the same reporter in a class and discovered that he was terrified of computers and didn't want to appear stupid. He confessed that his
  8
  -year-old often helped him when he was forced to do something with the computer besides basic writing and filing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It dawned on me that most reporters have no idea what they do for a living. I have been informally polling reporters and editors since then trying to get an idea of what they perceive as their jobs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most journalists think of themselves as writers. While they go out and gather news, they perceive that their main function is to write. It’s actually just the opposite. Journalists spend the vast majority of their time gathering information. The amount of time spent on writing and filing takes up, at most, a couple of hours at the end of the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the focus on writing, most reporters are inefficient news gatherers and analysts. That wasn’t much of a problem when most information was in some source’s head or printed on a piece of paper stuck in a file cabinet somewhere. If you had good sources who also could help you follow the paper trail, you could usually come up with a good story and scoop the competition. But the vast majority of information today is stored in a database and much of it is online.
 </p>
 <p>
  Any reporter who thinks that the job of journalism can be practiced without CAR skills will shortly be out of work. That probably seems overstated, but the fact is that the pace of change has accelerated, and there is no sign that it is slowing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two years ago, I got up in public and said that the Internet was an interesting concept, but that it would be years before it was useful to anyone but us geeks. I was wrong, really wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  And those who think that journalism hasn’t changed and will be changed are looking in the wrong direction. Your back is turned.
