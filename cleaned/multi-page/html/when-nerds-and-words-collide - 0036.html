  Reporters at
  <em>
   The News & Observer
  </em>
  in Raleigh, N.C., have had every advantage. Since the early ’90s, they have had ready access to tremendous computing power and a direct connection to the Internet, more than 350 databases, extensive training opportunities, and a world-class intranet.
 </p>
 <p>
  And like a bunch of spoiled brats, they take it for granted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since 1996, nine reporters have enjoyed a monthlong CAR fellowship during which they are expected to produce nothing, but to learn, the idea being that they will emerge as full-fledged CAR reporters and begin to plow through databases with lightning intensity, racking up Pulitzer after Pulitzer.
 </p>
 <p>
  These fellowship graduates have put a combined total of 27 CAR stories in the paper. That’s one per year per graduate. This isn’t exactly what we had planned.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it’s also not the entire picture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   The News & Observer
  </em>
  has enjoyed a reputation as a mecca for computer assisted reporting and for technological innovation, we didn’t always have it so good. When Pat Stith got the database bug at an IRE conference, he found willing converts among the library staff. We had been working with databases and had an inkling of how powerful they could be. Newsroom management, however, was a little less enlightened. The managing editor’s response was, “We sure don’t want Pat Stith touching a computer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually, he was able to persuade management that building a database of campaign contributions for the upcoming Senate contest between Jesse Helms and Harvey Gantt would be worthwhile. In fact, Pat’s brother had some technical expertise and could help us build such a database. There was a hoity-toity lunch with the big guys, all on their best behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then reality set in. The project was big and it was time consuming. Interest began to cool, as did the reception Pat’s brother received in the newsroom. In fact, they took to sneaking in on weekends to work on this project. It was grassroots determination rather than direction from management that got that first database built and its stories in the paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, our legendary big break came with the changing of the guard. Frank Daniels III understood the power of databases in all aspects of business. It also didn’t hurt that he was fascinated by the latest gizmos and he really
  <em>
   really
  </em>
  liked national (or more) recognition for the company. We were only too happy to oblige.
 </p>
 <p>
  We began to buy PCs. We began to hire people. And when the Internet came over the horizon, we were there! During this time we identified and put into place several initiatives to promote CAR among the news staff. One of the most radical and beneficial of these was a computer loan program in which employees received interest-free loans for the purchase of a computer. This idea came from the understanding that in order to learn to use a computer to its fullest potential, a journalist needed access, preferably in his home or on his desk. Having all the tools in place, we set our sights toward putting stories in the paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our philosophy about computer assisted reporting has always been that the stories should drive the databases, not the other way around. So we don’t make a big splash over technique or state in the newspaper that a story is computer assisted. This can sometimes make CAR stories difficult to identify. There also can be some fuzziness about what counts as a CAR story. Do multiple stories from the same database count multiple times? Do spreadsheets count? How about database lookups or online searches? The definition we settled on for a CAR story is one that uses data from a database or spreadsheet, homemade or acquired. This does not include a story written on a computer, interviews conducted over e-mail, or background material gathered through online searches of other publications.
 </p>
 <p>
  We did want to quantify our work, however, so we track CAR stories in our electronic archive. After just a handful in 1990, our production went up to 47 the next year to a record high of 82 in 1993. Because of the inexact nature of our count, along with differing opinions over the years regarding which stories to count, it may be more illustrative to state that we’ve published an average of 57 CAR stories per year for the past eight years. CAR stories have spanned just about every desk - metro, government, business, sports, features. We even published a computer assisted bridal section!
 </p>
 <p>
  Another chapter in our CAR history is the various staff configurations we’ve tried out over the years. We’ve had a database editor based in the news research department, a CAR editor in the newsroom, and a triad of editors reporting to different departments with nobody in charge. We’ve also had a variety of skills in those jobs, from bona fide computer nerd to statistician to old-school investigative reporter. All of these arrangements have helped to shape the configuration we have today - a database manager, assigned to news research, who maintains our PC network, oversees the acquisition and loading of databases, and builds front-end tools for ready reference access to some databases. While the database manager also works with reporters in analyzing databases and doing the stories, this is slowly becoming a research function that will involve all of our news researchers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, training is vital to our CAR program. As with staffing, we’ve tried every approach to training invented. We’ve done weeklong classes, private tutorials, and intensive week-long and monthlong CAR fellowships. During the fellowships, reporters and editors are exposed to all of the electronic resources and research tools available at

   Teresa Leonard came to
   <em>
    The News & Observer
   </em>
   the day after graduating from UNO's School of Information and Library Science in 1987. In 1993, she became director of the news research department. The work of that department includes the creation of the paper's electronic searchable archives, reference and research services to the newsroom, creation of the company’s intranet, and computer assisted reporting.
