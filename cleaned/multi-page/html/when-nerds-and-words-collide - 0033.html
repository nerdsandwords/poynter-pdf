  Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear

  In praise of leather

 <p>
  It was my pal Dan Browning, now the CAR guru at the
  <em>
   Star Tribune
  </em>
  in Minneapolis, who said that we geeks have “the best job in journalism.” He’s right. We get to rummage through electronic filing cabinets in the name of authoritative repotting, we engage in an endless battle with snarled data, and we get to buy new toys more often than anybody else in the newsroom. It’s a sweet career for anyone, and I owe mine almost entirely to the Leather Goddesses of Phobos.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was 24 years old in early 1989 when Elliot Jaspin came to town spouting tales of corrupt Rhode Island politicians and reckless bus drivers whom he’d lassoed with spools of 9-track tape. Jaspin was about to start the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting in Columbia, Mo. My bosses at the
  <em>
   St. Louis Post-Dispatch
  </em>
  had hired him for a couple of days to help them choose someone to do computer assisted repotting full time. Only a handful of newspapers had reporters dedicated to CAR in those days, and it was only through the wisdom of projects editor Richard Weil (now the managing editor) that the
  <em>
   Post-Dispatch
  </em>
  was getting into the game early. It didn’t hurt that a publisher named Ralph Ingersoll had announced plans to start a new daily, the
  <em>
   St. Louis Sun.
  </em>
  Ingersoll’s competitive threat, which disappeared in a cloud of bankruptcy after just a seven-month run, prompted a brief spurt of newsroom improvements at the
  <em>
   Post-Dispatch,
  </em>
  and Weil managed to sneak computer assisted reporting into the mix.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’d spent about five years in full- and part-time gigs at the
  <em>
   Post-Dispatch,
  </em>
  writing features, working general assignment, and rotating through the suburban bureaus. When Weil first asked me if I’d be interested in the job, I knew nothing about computer assisted reporting and next to nothing about relational databases. But it sounded like my dream job, so I bought some books, started reading feverishly, and nervously awaited the interview. As I recall, two or three other folks were being considered for the job. One of them was an import they’d flown in from Atlanta, which made me suspect that my own chances were slim.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the interview, Jaspin asked most of the questions. The newsroom honchos sat to the side, taking notes. I sweated and tried to sound knowledgeable about relational database theory, but it was clear to everyone that I didn’t know what I was talking about. Near the end of the ordeal, Jaspin asked me if I played computer games. Uh-oh, I thought, he’s making chitchat, which means I’m done for. I said no, not much, although I did enjoy those text-based adventure games, the ones where you have to type your way out of a densely plotted labyrinth. I mentioned “Leather Goddesses of Phobos,” from whom I had been trying to escape for the last few days. I said I didn’t know much about the truly cool games, the ones that had stunning graphics and aerial dogfights. Jaspin smiled politely and said, “Thanks, we’ll get back to you.” I felt like a game show contestant who had struck out and was being sent home with the vacuum cleaner consolation prize.
 </p>
 <p>
  I returned sullenly to my desk in the newsroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he later told me I had the job, Weil explained that “Leather Goddesses” had been the clincher. Jaspin had read somewhere that people who enjoyed those text-based mazes were supposed to be good at programming and problemsolving. I was flabbergasted but not inclined to argue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the next 10 years, I became so distracted with data and its distribution in a newsroom that I never found my way off Phobos. Some things are better left as mysteries.

  Beyond leather
 </h4>
 <p>
  If the preceding narrative has a purpose beyond nostalgia, it’s to illustrate that you don’t need to know anything about computer assisted reporting in order to learn it, master it, and enjoy it. If there’s one principle that has guided me for the last 10 years, and which has never failed to unknot my gut in the face of the most intimidating obstacles, it’s that in this field, you can’t ever let yourself believe that you’re done learning.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes CAR the best job in journalism is that the need for constant learning applies equally to reporting and to computers. You can’t be a good reporter if you’ve lost the ability to ask questions and find answers, and you can’t squeeze knowledge from a PC unless you know how to use the software to explore and organize the data. And since the stories and the software are constantly changing, CAR specialists never rest. It’s probably the only career that has so much built-in protection against senile dementia.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I look back on my 10 years in the field of computer assisted reporting, I see a clear progression from one to many -from starting as a solo act (the guru phase), to building a CAR infrastructure in my newsroom (the engineer phase), to building a set of CAR tools intended for newsrooms everywhere (the entrepreneur phase).
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m not entirely sure about this, but I think that my particular career path and the course of the CAR field itself have been shaped by the same external factor: the availability of networked personal computers. As the network has grown, the role of the CAR specialist has transformed from gura-on-the-mountaintop to a mix of highway engineer and gas station attendant.

  Back in 1989,1 had the only remotely speedy PC in the entire
