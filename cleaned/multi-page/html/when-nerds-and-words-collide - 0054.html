  My perspective of computer assisted reporting might be different from most because I am not in a newsroom - and haven’t worked in one for eight years. Not only that, I never actually used CAR because it was an unknown tool when I was a reporter back in the “dark ages.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I came into CAR because the putpose of my current job is to help our newsrooms deal with technology. Obviously, that includes a lot of front-end systems work, but only a few months into my then-new job, it became clear that our reporters needed help with technology, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem was that short of using a spreadsheet program to produce a newsroom budget,

  knew nothing about the tools required for computer assisted reporting - let alone how to use them. So, in the spring of 19911 attended my first CAR conference - the National Institute for Advanced Reporting. I’m not sure how much I learned at that conference - other than how little I really did know.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two years later, I attended the first National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting conference in Raleigh, N.C. That’s when everything began to make sense, and I knew what needed to be done at our newspapers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after that conference, we assembled a task force of reporters, editors, and others from our newspapers to address how we were going to get these new tools into the hands of our reporters and how we were going to teach them to use the tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result of that meeting, we started a series of on-the-road training sessions aimed at teaching Gannett reporters and midlevel editors the basics of computer assisted reporting. Each session lasted three days and included hands-on training in spreadsheets and databases. Initially, Jennifer LaFleur, then NICAR training director, conducted the hands-on sessions, but after she left NICAR, we felt comfortable enough to assume that task. We also made sure that every newsroom had spreadsheet and database software; if it didn’t, we purchased it. In a three-year period we provided basic CAR training for more than 160 reporters and editors from 56 of our 75 newspapers. (By design we focused on our larger newspapers because we felt their staffers were more likely to use the skills.)
 </p>
 <p>
  We also created a private listserv so that Gannett reporters and editors could continue to help each other. The list has about 90 members and is fairly active. It also has a website on which members can post stories, data, executable software programs, and so on, to share with others.
 </p>
 <p>
  And we have seen very rewarding results from this training -as well as the training provided at the annual NICAR conferences, which are attended by 50 to 80 of our reporters and editors each year. Clearly our newsrooms - many of them quite small - are using their computer assisted reporting skills to provide more depth and sophistication to their stories - and to do some truly original project work.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think this reflects what is happening around the country. Reporters and editors who were rank beginners at the Raleigh
 </p>
 <p>
  NICAR conference are now teaching advanced techniques. The addition of more advanced workshop and hands-on sessions at NICAR conferences reflect that same shift in the level of expertise that has evolved in the past five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, this is not true everywhere - and that brings me to one of the issues that needs to be addressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  At our training sessions, we required that at least one participant from each newspaper be an editor, primarily because we wanted to make sure that someone in a position of authority could work with the reporters to ensure that they were given the time and assistance necessary to put their skills to work. In many cases that worked well; in some it didn’t.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some mid-level editors have told me that they have a hard time convincing their fellow editors that CAR is a worthwhile skill. For that reason, they say it is difficult to get other editors to free up reporters’ time to work on CAR stories. As a result, the trained reporters get discouraged, give up, and, in some cases, leave the newspaper, taking what little they remember with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even some of those who have learned the skills - and who are doing CAR work - have not done a good job of passing those skills along to others in their newsrooms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many top editors are woefully ignorant of the value of computer assisted reporting - or even the value of web resources for everyday reporting. They’ll send someone to a three-day training session and assume that’s all the reporter needs. I find tins incomprehensible, since these same editors appear to understand that it takes continuing training to produce good writers. The top editors also are ignorant of the time it takes to do CAR work; they figure if you’re using a computer to do the calculations and searches it should be faster than doing it by hand. It is, of course, but these editors fail to realize how long it takes to clean up the data.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the same token, many reporters have the same attitude. They find out that CAR is hard work, and they don’t want to put forth the effort. Of course, most learn this after the initial training session, so if basic training weeds out the less dedicated, perhaps it serves its purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not surprisingly, our most successful CAR efforts are from newspapers in which a reporter or editor truly loves the work and is willing to find the time to do it - regardless of the obstacles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking of which, there still are equipment and access obstacles. Despite the fact that many newspapers are installing

   <em>
    Pensacola News Journal
   </em>
   in 1966 and moved to
   <em>
    The Orlando Sentinel
   </em>
   in 1968. She joined
