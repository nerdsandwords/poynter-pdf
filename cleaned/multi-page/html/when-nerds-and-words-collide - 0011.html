  Changes in Attitudes, Changes in Latitudes
 </h3>
 <p>

 <p>
  Computer assisted reporting (CAR) has been more of an evolution than a revolution. In the 10 years since the first CAR conference was held and two CAR institutes were started, there have been significant, but sometimes hard to see, changes. Among those changes:
 </p>
 <li>
  The acceptance of CAR as a integral part not only of projects reporting, but also of daily and beat reporting.
 </li>
 <li>
  A stunning increase in the demand for training seminars.
 </li>
 <li>
  A substantial growth in the number of journalists using these techniques.
 </li>
 <li>
  The development of a generally accepted curriculum and syllabus.
 </li>
 <li>
  The spread of CAR to other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and Central and South America.
 </li>
 <p>
  While there continue to be doubts and fears among veteran journalists about the use of CAR, the resistance is weakening to software that allows a journalist to give depth and context to daily, beat, and project stories. Furthermore, the speed of reporting has increased with the advent of the World Wide Web, software that’s easier to use, and the availability of more databases online.
 </p>
 <p>
  But rather than dwell on generalities, I will use the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (NICAR) as an example and mirror of the overall changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Missouri School of Journalism and CAR pioneer Elliot Jaspin created the institute in 1989. At that time, the institute was named the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (MICAR).
 </p>
 <p>
  Jaspin had built a national reputation for himself while at the
  <em>
   Providence Journal-Bulletin
  </em>
  by learning to download and analyze information on computer tapes. Although he had won a Pulitzer Prize while he worked for a Pennsylvania daily years earlier, Jaspin had won no major awards for his CAR work. Yet magazine articles about the stories he culled from his data analysis attracted the attention of other investigative journalists.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Jaspin did not use traditional social science research methods (unlike another database reporting pioneer, Philip Meyer), his counting, summing, and comparing of information in databases resulted in hard-hitting exposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to showing by example, Jaspin made a critical contribution while on a Freedom Forum Fellowship. On leave from the Providence paper, Jaspin teamed with a computer programmer, Daniel Woods, to develop software called 9-Track Express, which was a major technical breakthrough because it gave journalists an easier way to get information off computer tapes.
 </p>
 <p>
  That innovation freed journalists from learning the more complex programming language required by mainframe computers and from having to find time and space on mainframes that were being primarily used at newspapers for payroll, advertising, marketing, and circulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Jaspin arrived at the University of Missouri, he quickly
 </p>
 <p>
  put together a series of one-week seminars for journalists eager to learn how to download data and analyze databases. Most of the journalists who came to Missouri were veteran investigative reporters who had been doing databases in hard copy - that is, creating and sorting index cards, looking for connections between campaign contributions and government contracts, searching through libraries and documents for patterns of waste, fraud, or racial disparity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jaspin also began teaching a class in computer assisted reporting at Missouri and had graduate students write a newsletter, called
  <em>
   Uplink,
  </em>
  and create a database library that collected and distributed useful government databases.
 </p>
 <p>
  The seminars, known as “boot camps,” generally had eight to 12 journalists or system administrators. The boot camps included lessons and lectures on computer tape downloading, database analysis using Structured Query Language, and understanding the roots of data, including how 0’s and 1 ’s combined to create the characters and numbers on a computer screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boot camps were intellectually tough and sometimes frustrating for journalists who had little or no training in computer programming. But many of those who attended became the second wave of CAR pioneers. The successful boot campers returned to newsrooms, argued for hardware and software, produced in-depth stories, and set up training programs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc., a professional organization begun in 1975, had its offices just down the hall and because many new CAR journalists were IRE members, a natural association formed between MICAR and IRE. And when Jaspin left Missouri in 1992 because of a serious illness in his family, it was not surprising that the IRE executive director, Andy Scott, and other volunteers kept the seminars going while Missouri searched for a replacement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, IRE board member Bill Dedman set out to obtain a grant for computer assisted reporting that would permit the seminars given at Missouri to be taken to other locations. In 1993, Dedman won a $225,000 grant for IRE from the Freedom Forum to take the seminars on the road. At the same time, IRE and the Missouri School of Journalism worked out an agreement that would make the institute a joint program of the school and IRE.

   Brant Houston is executive director of IRE and an assistant professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. He was previously managing director of NICAR. A daily journalist for 17 years, he worked at
   <em>
    The Hartford Courant, The Kansas City Star,
   </em>
   and several news organizations in the Boston area.

 <p>
  In late 1993, IRE hired me as the managing director of the yet-unnamed institute, and in early 1994 several pieces of the program came together. After I arrived, I persuaded everyone to call the institute the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (NICAR), so we could have a letterhead and have
