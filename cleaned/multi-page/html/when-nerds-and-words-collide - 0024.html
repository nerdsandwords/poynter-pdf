  It’s Time to Drive CAR Concepts Home
 </h3>

  I like to think of myself as living proof that if you’re bright enough to be a good reporter, you’re bright enough to leam to do computer assisted reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking back, I now realize I was interested in computer assisted reporting even before I knew I was going to be a reporter. My freshman calculus professor at Dartmouth College in 1966 was John Kemeny, the co-inventor of the BASIC computer language. Kemeny’s novel idea was that computers, which still were Big Iron in those distant days, could and should be used even by us non-techie liberal arts types. I remember almost nothing of calculus today, but the experience of fooling around with BASIC programs stuck with me as I wandered from one major to the next during my on-again, off-again college career.
 </p>
 <p>
  Arguably, my first CAR effort was in 1974 for a senior-year government paper analyzing the emerging Republican presence in Florida, using the statistics functions built into Dartmouth’s computer system. By that time, during a three-year hiatus from college at the dean’s insistence, the U.S. Army had taught me the rudiments of being a reporter. But it was eight years later before I started doing CAR as a real journalist.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1982, I was in
  <em>
   The Miami Herald’s
  </em>
  Tallahassee bureau covering state government. At home, I had been reading a lot about hobby computers like the Altair and Apple. Finally, to my wife’s horror, I spent a couple thousand dollars to buy an Atari 800 system (loaded with 16K of RAM!), and enjoyed relearning BASIC by writing little programs to teach my kids addition and how to tell time. However, the more I played with the Atari at home, the more I kept realizing how a computer might help me do things as work, such as calculating state budget changes or tracking campaign contribution reports.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few months later, the bureau added a reporter and we needed another writing terminal. I persuaded the
  <em>
   Herald
  </em>
  instead to buy one of the new IBM PCs (64K RAM, a 360K floppy, green monochrome screen and a screamin’ 4MHz!). Along with the word processor XyWrite, I bought the PC flavor of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet, and started using it for budget analyses and other stories. My first real CAR application, though, was a BASIC program I wrote to analyze legislative roll-call votes on deadline. It would take the yeas and nays and churn out crosstabs on the split not just by party, but also by region, gender, race, special interest contributions, leadership vs. rank-and-file, et al. I even made it write out the “How they Voted” agate. (Of course, today such an application can be built in minutes with an off-the-shelf database.)
 </p>
 <p>
  About the same time, I discovered Phil Meyer and
  <em>
   Precision Journalism.
  </em>
  During his years with Knight Ridder, Meyer was the first in a string of reporters at the
  <em>
   Herald
  </em>
  to use such social science methods as polling and statistical analysis on reporting problems. In about 1983, the
  <em>
   Herald
  </em>
  training depaxtment had brought Meyer, by then a professor at the University of North Carolina, to talk up his precision vision to a handful of math-adept
  <em>
   Herald
  </em>
  reporters such as Richard Morin (now director of
 </p>
 <p>
  polling for
  <em>
   The Washington Post
  </em>
  ) and myself. I got a copy of the book, and decided I wanted to be Phil Meyer when I grew up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I transferred back to the
  <em>
   Herald’s
  </em>
  main office in 1984, covering courts and then science. But I also missed my Tallahassee IBM, so I spent another couple grand on a PC-XT (with a spacious 10 megabyte hard drive and speedy 1200 baud modem!). In Miami, the same pattern occurred: The more cool things I learned to do on my hobby computer at home, the more I kept seeing ways it could be used at work.
 </p>
 <p>
  And not just for my own work. It seemed like every day I’d be walking past the desk of some reporter or other, and see him or her doing something like adding up a long column of numbers using a cheap calculator or digging through a thick stack of project notes looking for a particular quote. More and more, I found myself stopping to say, “Hey, I’ve got a way to help you with that.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Before long, I was spending one or two days a week at home, working on other reporters’ projects with my personal computer. (I’m grateful that my editors let me get away with this apparent dereliction of my own work.) After a while, desktop computers started showing up in the
  <em>
   Herald
  </em>
  newsroom - though only on the desks of executive secretaries. So I started sneaking onto one of those computers when the desk’s occupant was out to lunch or had gone home. My contributions to others’ stories, and some projects of my own, finally became visible enough that when the secretaries’ machines were upgraded, I was given one of the hand-me-downs. My career as CAR specialist was semiofficial!
 </p>
 <p>
  My leap into high-end CAR came in 1990 when the
  <em>
   Herald
  </em>
  started a project on money-laundering in South Florida. The project reporters came to me and said they could get all sorts of data on 9-track magnetic tape, but they didn’t know how to work with the stuff. Neither did I, but I nodded sagely and said I’d figure something out. As it happened, the
  <em>
   Herald’s
  </em>
  business side had just hired a new vice president to oversee the company’s data processing department. I met her as she was touring the building and mentioned our project. Without missing a beat, she said she’d check into it.

   Stephen K. Doig is Knight Chair in Journalism, specializing in computer assisted reporting, at Arizona State University. Before Joining ASU in 1996, he was research editor of
   <em>
    The Miami Herald,
   </em>
   where he worked for 19 years. Computer assisted projects on which he worked at the
   <em>
    Herald
   </em>
   have won the Pulitzer Prize, the IRE Grand Prize, the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting, and other awards.

  Next thing I knew, I was given free and complete access to the
  <em>
   Herald’s
  </em>
  IBM mainframe and enough instruction from the
  <em>
   real
  </em>
  programmers there to soon be writing my own SAS programs and job control language. I realize that some CAR veterans, such as Elliot Jaspin, insist that the newsroom should develop its own capability to work with tape data. My experience at the
