  makes me argue that, at the least, we should make overtures to our data processing folks. Instead of having to squeeze the newsroom budget to buy some cranky desktop tape drive, chances are all the equipment you need is sitting somewhere else in your building. (A further tip: A bit of humility goes a long way. The DP folks kept remarking that I was great to work with because I wasn’t an arrogant prima donna like most reporters. It made me appreciate how little-liked we reporters are - even within our own walls.)
 </p>
 <p>
  My bosses gave me lots of freedom (and even a little funding) to learn almost anything I thought would be a good CAR tool. My position soon evolved into a full-time CAR consultancy, allowing me to work with reporters and editors from any desk, and even occasionally on non-newsroom projects. I deliberately sought that role, because I liked the challenge of solving the wide range of reporting problems that were brought to me. Some CAR specialists worry about being treated as “the nerd in the corner,” not seen as real journalists. I sympathize with that concern for young CAR specialists, but it wasn’t a problem for me, thanks to my longevity at the
  <em>

  </em>
  and my success with some high-visibility projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  This raises one of the big continuing issues with CAR: Should all reporters and editors leant these skills? I favor the tier model:
 </p>
 <li>
  All reporters and editors should know what CAR can do, so they don’t waste time or lose story opportunities. They should at least be able to know when to go find a CAR specialist for help.
 </li>
 <li>
  All reporters and editors should learn at least the rudiments of online research, such as using search engines.
 </li>
 <li>
  Reporters and editors who have enough math skills to reliably calculate percentage change should learn to use a spreadsheet. (Some journalists are too math-challenged to be allowed near software that will let them make thousands of mistakes in a split second.)
 </li>
 <li>
  The few who start to hit the limits of what spreadsheets can do should be encouraged to learn a good database program.
 </li>
 <li>
  Finally, someone in the newsroom should know the high-end tricks: statistical analysis, mapping, tape cracking, polling, applications programming, intranet development, et al.
 </li>
 <p>
  In other words, a newsroom full of people like me would be a disaster. But every newsroom should have at least one!
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that I keep mentioning editors. I feel the most worrisome CAR issue right now is the lack of editors who understand CAR. During much of my career at the
  <em>

  </em>
  my editors basically had to trust me that I did my data analyses right. Not until Rich Gordon joined the
  <em>

  </em>
  did I have someone else I could
 </p>
 <p>
  bounce my methodology off to see if it made sense. With most journalism skills, you can generally count on your editors to have considerable experience and insight that will help make your story better and guide you away from pitfalls. But CAR has been very much a bottom-up movement, which means that there are too few editors who know enough to spot messy data, bad formulas, or shaky assumptions. That may change as more CAR veterans start moving into the supervisory ranks. But the very success of the CAR training programs at creating hundreds of eager computer assisted reporters means that editor/reporter ratio still is dangerously small. We haven’t had a CAR disaster of Janet Cooke proportions - but we will if our bosses keep letting us do ever-more complicated projects without competent backstopping from good editors.
 </p>
 <p>
  I needn’t go on at length about the progress that CAR has made in journalism. When we graybeards started doing this, we were scattered in a few newsrooms around the country, not even knowing that there were a few others trying the same thing. Today, hundreds of papers routinely publish stories that simply would have been impossible without CAR. We’ve given our readers and viewers access to information they couldn’t have gotten so easily before, whether it is neighborhood crime statistics, local property value changes, or school test score comparisons. I think it is extraordinary that such radically new techniques have been adopted so quickly and broadly in a profession as basically conservative as journalism.

  But much progress remains to be made. Basic CAR ability -the use of spreadsheets and online research - needs to be seen as much a job qualification for a reporter as the ability to type and spell. Unfortunately, I think that the next 10 years will see much slower growth of CAR into newsrooms and classrooms than occurred during the past decade. We CAR evangelists have already skimmed the cream by capturing the interest and enthusiasm of the hundreds of reporters (and a few professors) who have a natural aptitude for this kind of work. By now, though, thousands of other reporters and editors (and professors) have seen what CAR can do. If they haven’t already said, “Wow, I gotta leam to do some of that!” then chances are they won’t. The answer, I think, is found in journalism schools. They must find ways to spread CAR concepts into every skills class across the curriculum, rather than being satisfied with offering a high-level computer course that only a tiny fraction of students will take. Only when the majority of J-grads are CAR-aware and start filling newsrooms from the bottom up will CAR skills go from being a bonus to being a requirement.
